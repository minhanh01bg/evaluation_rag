It enables zero-shot subject-driven generation and control-guided zero-shot generation. The abstract from the paper is:\\n\\\\*Subject-driven text-to-image generation models create novel renditions of an input subject based on text prompts. Existing models suffer from lengthy fine-tuning and difficulties preserving the subject fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce BLIP-Diffusion, a new subject-driven image generation model that supports multimodal control which consumes inputs of subject images and text prompts. Unlike other subject-driven generation models, BLIP-Diffusion introduces a new multimodal encoder which is pre-trained to provide subject representation. We first pre-train the multimodal encoder following BLIP-2 to produce visual representation aligned with the text. Then we design a subject representation learning task which enables a diffusion model to leverage such visual representation and generates new subject renditions. Compared with previous methods such as DreamBooth, our model enables zero-shot subject-driven generation, and efficient fine-tuning for customized subject with up to 20x speedup. We also demonstrate that BLIP-Diffusion can be flexibly combined with existing techniques such as ControlNet and prompt-to-prompt to enable novel subject-driven generation and editing applications.

Popular examples (at the time of writing) include [GLIDE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10741) and [DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) by OpenAI, [Latent Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion) by the University of Heidelberg and [ImageGen](https://imagen.research.google/) by Google Brain. We\\'ll go over the original DDPM paper by ([Ho et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239)), implementing it step-by-step in PyTorch, based on Phil Wang\\'s [implementation](https://github.com/lucidrains/denoising-diffusion-pytorch) - which itself is based on the [original TensorFlow implementation](https://github.com/hojonathanho/diffusion). Note that the idea of diffusion for generative modeling was actually already introduced in ([Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03585)). However, it took until ([Song et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05600)) (at Stanford University), and then ([Ho et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239)) (at Google Brain) who independently improved the approach. Note that there are [several perspectives](https://twitter.com/sedielem/status/1530894256168222722?s=20&t=mfv4afx1GcNQU5fZklpACw) on diffusion models. Here, we employ the discrete-time (latent variable model) perspective, but be sure to check out the other perspectives as well.

The [`StableDiffusionPipeline`] is capable of generating photorealistic images given any text input. It\\'s trained on 512x512 images from a subset of the LAION-5B dataset. This model uses a frozen CLIP ViT-L/14 text encoder to condition the model on text prompts. With its 860M UNet and 123M text encoder, the model is relatively lightweight and can run on consumer GPUs. Latent diffusion is the research on top of which Stable Diffusion was built. It was proposed in [High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models](https://huggingface.co/papers/2112.10752) by Robin Rombach, Andreas Blattmann, Dominik Lorenz, Patrick Esser, Björn Ommer. The abstract from the paper is:\\n\\\\*By decomposing the image formation process into a sequential application of denoising autoencoders, diffusion models (DMs) achieve state-of-the-art synthesis results on image data and beyond. Additionally, their formulation allows for a guiding mechanism to control the image generation process without retraining. However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By introducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn diffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning inputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes possible in a convolutional manner. Our latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve a new state of the art for image inpainting and highly competitive performance on various tasks, including unconditional image generation, semantic scene synthesis, and super-resolution, while significantly reducing computational requirements compared to pixel-based DMs.\\n\\n🧨 Diffusers Pipelines\\nPipelines provide a simple way to run state-of-the-art diffusion models in inference. Most diffusion systems consist of multiple independently-trained models and highly adaptable scheduler\\ncomponents - all of which are needed to have a functioning end-to-end diffusion system. As an example, [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/blog/stable\\\\_diffusion) has three independently trained models:\\n- [Autoencoder](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/5cbed8e0d157f65d3ddc2420dfd09f2df630e978/src/diffusers/models/vae.py#L392)\\n- [Conditional Unet](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/5cbed8e0d157f65d3ddc2420dfd09f2df630e978/src/diffusers/models/unet\\\\_2d\\\\_condition.py#L12)\\n- [CLIP text encoder](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model\\\\_doc/clip#transformers.CLIPTextModel)\\n- a scheduler component, [scheduler](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/schedulers/scheduling\\\\_pndm.py),\\n- a [CLIPImageProcessor](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model\\\\_doc/clip#transformers.CLIPImageProcessor),\\n- as well as a [safety checker](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/pipelines/stable\\\\_diffusion/safety\\\\_checker.py).

It enables zero-shot subject-driven generation and control-guided zero-shot generation. The abstract from the paper is:\\n\\\\*Subject-driven text-to-image generation models create novel renditions of an input subject based on text prompts. Existing models suffer from lengthy fine-tuning and difficulties preserving the subject fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce BLIP-Diffusion, a new subject-driven image generation model that supports multimodal control which consumes inputs of subject images and text prompts. Unlike other subject-driven generation models, BLIP-Diffusion introduces a new multimodal encoder which is pre-trained to provide subject representation. We first pre-train the multimodal encoder following BLIP-2 to produce visual representation aligned with the text. Then we design a subject representation learning task which enables a diffusion model to leverage such visual representation and generates new subject renditions. Compared with previous methods such as DreamBooth, our model enables zero-shot subject-driven generation, and efficient fine-tuning for customized subject with up to 20x speedup. We also demonstrate that BLIP-Diffusion can be flexibly combined with existing techniques such as ControlNet and prompt-to-prompt to enable novel subject-driven generation and editing applications.

Popular examples (at the time of writing) include [GLIDE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10741) and [DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) by OpenAI, [Latent Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion) by the University of Heidelberg and [ImageGen](https://imagen.research.google/) by Google Brain. We'll go over the original DDPM paper by ([Ho et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239)), implementing it step-by-step in PyTorch, based on Phil Wang's [implementation](https://github.com/lucidrains/denoising-diffusion-pytorch) - which itself is based on the [original TensorFlow implementation](https://github.com/hojonathanho/diffusion). Note that the idea of diffusion for generative modeling was actually already introduced in ([Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03585)). However, it took until ([Song et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05600)) (at Stanford University), and then ([Ho et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239)) (at Google Brain) who independently improved the approach. Note that there are [several perspectives](https://twitter.com/sedielem/status/1530894256168222722?s=20&t=mfv4afx1GcNQU5fZklpACw) on diffusion models. Here, we employ the discrete-time (latent variable model) perspective, but be sure to check out the other perspectives as well.

The [`StableDiffusionPipeline`] is capable of generating photorealistic images given any text input. It\\'s trained on 512x512 images from a subset of the LAION-5B dataset. This model uses a frozen CLIP ViT-L/14 text encoder to condition the model on text prompts. With its 860M UNet and 123M text encoder, the model is relatively lightweight and can run on consumer GPUs. Latent diffusion is the research on top of which Stable Diffusion was built. It was proposed in [High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models](https://huggingface.co/papers/2112.10752) by Robin Rombach, Andreas Blattmann, Dominik Lorenz, Patrick Esser, Björn Ommer. The abstract from the paper is:\\n\\\\*By decomposing the image formation process into a sequential application of denoising autoencoders, diffusion models (DMs) achieve state-of-the-art synthesis results on image data and beyond. Additionally, their formulation allows for a guiding mechanism to control the image generation process without retraining. However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By introducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn diffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning inputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes possible in a convolutional manner.

It\\'s an\\nencoder-decoder transformer pre-trained in a text-to-text denoising generative setting. LongT5 model is an extension of\\nT5 model, and it enables using one of the two different efficient attention mechanisms - (1) Local attention, or (2)\\nTransient-Global attention. The abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*Recent work has shown that either (1) increasing the input length or (2) increasing model size can improve the\\nperformance of Transformer-based neural models. In this paper, we present a new model, called LongT5, with which we\\nexplore the effects of scaling both the input length and model size at the same time. Specifically, we integrated\\nattention ideas from long-input transformers (ETC), and adopted pre-training strategies from summarization pre-training\\n(PEGASUS) into the scalable T5 architecture. The result is a new attention mechanism we call {\\\\em Transient Global}\\n(TGlobal), which mimics ETC\\'s local/global attention mechanism, but without requiring additional side-inputs. We are\\nable to achieve state-of-the-art results on several summarization tasks and outperform the original T5 models on\\nquestion answering tasks.\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [stancld](https://huggingface.co/stancld). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/longt5). ## Usage tips\\n- [`LongT5ForConditionalGeneration`] is an extension of [`T5ForConditionalGeneration`] exchanging the traditional\\nencoder \\\\*self-attention\\\\* layer with efficient either \\\\*local\\\\* attention or \\\\*transient-global\\\\* (\\\\*tglobal\\\\*) attention. - Unlike the T5 model, LongT5 does not use a task prefix. Furthermore, it uses a different pre-training objective\\ninspired by the pre-training of [`PegasusForConditionalGeneration`]. - LongT5 model is designed to work efficiently and very well on long-range \\\\*sequence-to-sequence\\\\* tasks where the\\ninput sequence exceeds commonly used 512 tokens. It is capable of handling input sequences of a length up to 16,384 tokens. - For \\\\*Local Attention\\\\*, the sparse sliding-window local attention operation allows a given token to attend only `r`\\ntokens to the left and right of it (with `r=127` by default). \\\\*Local Attention\\\\* does not introduce any new parameters\\nto the model. The complexity of the mechanism is linear in input sequence length `l`: `O(l\\\\*r)`. - \\\\*Transient Global Attention\\\\* is an extension of the \\\\*Local Attention\\\\*. It, furthermore, allows each input token to\\ninteract with all other tokens in the layer. This is achieved via splitting an input sequence into blocks of a fixed\\nlength `k` (with a default `k=16`). Then, a global token for such a block is obtained via summing and normalizing the embeddings of every token\\nin the block. Thanks to this, the attention allows each token to attend to both nearby tokens like in Local attention, and\\nalso every global token like in the case of standard global attention (\\\\*transient\\\\* represents the fact the global tokens\\nare constructed dynamically within each attention operation). As a consequence, \\\\*TGlobal\\\\* attention introduces\\na few new parameters -- global relative position biases and a layer normalization for global token\\'s embedding.\\n\\nsummarization). The memory consumption is thus reduced from \\\\\\\\(n\\\\_s^2+ n\\\\_s n\\\\_t +n\\\\_t^2\\\\\\\\) to \\\\\\\\(w n\\\\_s +gn\\\\_s +n\\\\_s n\\\\_t +n\\\\_t^2\\\\\\\\) with \\\\\\\\(n\\\\_s\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\(n\\\\_t\\\\\\\\) being the source (encoder input) and target (decoder input) lengths respectively. For Longformer Encoder-Decoder to be efficient, it is assumed that \\\\\\\\(n\\\\_s\\\\\\\\) is much bigger than \\\\\\\\(n\\\\_t\\\\\\\\). #### Main findings\\n\\\\* The authors proposed the dilated windowed self-attention (Figure c) and showed that it yields better results on language modeling compared to just windowed/sparse self-attention (Figure b). The window sizes are increased through the layers. This pattern further outperforms previous architectures (such as Transformer-XL, or adaptive span attention) on downstream benchmarks. \\\\* Global attention allows the information to flow through the whole sequence and applying the global attention to task-motivated tokens (such as the tokens of the question in QA, CLS token for sentence classification) leads to stronger performance on downstream tasks. Using this global pattern, Longformer can be successfully applied to document-level NLP tasks in the transfer learning setting.\\n\\nThe Authors\\' code can be found [here](https://github.com/allenai/longformer). ## Usage tips\\n- Since the Longformer is based on RoBERTa, it doesn\\'t have `token\\\\_type\\\\_ids`. You don\\'t need to indicate which\\ntoken belongs to which segment. Just separate your segments with the separation token `tokenizer.sep\\\\_token` (or\\n``). - A transformer model replacing the attention matrices by sparse matrices to go faster. Often, the local context (e.g., what are the two tokens left and right?) is enough to take action for a given token. Some preselected input tokens are still given global attention, but the attention matrix has way less parameters, resulting in a speed-up. See the local attention section for more information. ## Longformer Self Attention\\nLongformer self attention employs self attention on both a \"local\" context and a \"global\" context. Most tokens only\\nattend \"locally\" to each other meaning that each token attends to its \\\\\\\\(\\\\frac{1}{2} w\\\\\\\\) previous tokens and\\n\\\\\\\\(\\\\frac{1}{2} w\\\\\\\\) succeeding tokens with \\\\\\\\(w\\\\\\\\) being the window length as defined in\\n`config.attention\\\\_window`. Note that `config.attention\\\\_window` can be of type `List` to define a\\ndifferent \\\\\\\\(w\\\\\\\\) for each layer. A selected few tokens attend \"globally\" to all other tokens, as it is\\nconventionally done for all tokens in `BertSelfAttention`. Note that \"locally\" and \"globally\" attending tokens are projected by different query, key and value matrices. Also note\\nthat every \"locally\" attending token not only attends to tokens within its window \\\\\\\\(w\\\\\\\\), but also to all \"globally\"\\nattending tokens so that global attention is \\\\*symmetric\\\\*. The user can define which tokens attend \"locally\" and which tokens attend \"globally\" by setting the tensor\\n`global\\\\_attention\\\\_mask` at run-time appropriately. All Longformer models employ the following logic for\\n`global\\\\_attention\\\\_mask`:\\n- 0: the token attends \"locally\",\\n- 1: the token attends \"globally\". For more information please also refer to [`~LongformerModel.forward`] method. Using Longformer self attention, the memory and time complexity of the query-key matmul operation, which usually\\nrepresents the memory and time bottleneck, can be reduced from \\\\\\\\(\\\\mathcal{O}(n\\\\_s \\\\times n\\\\_s)\\\\\\\\) to\\n\\\\\\\\(\\\\mathcal{O}(n\\\\_s \\\\times w)\\\\\\\\), with \\\\\\\\(n\\\\_s\\\\\\\\) being the sequence length and \\\\\\\\(w\\\\\\\\) being the average window\\nsize.\\n\\nThe first drawback of this architecture becomes obvious: Some input vectors have no access to their immediate context, \\\\*e.g.\\\\* \\\\\\\\(\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\_9\\\\\\\\) has no access to \\\\\\\\(\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\_{8}\\\\\\\\) and vice-versa in our example. This is problematic because these tokens are not able to learn word representations that take their immediate context into account. A simple remedy is to augment each chunk with `config.local\\\\_num\\\\_chunks\\\\_before`, \\\\*i.e.\\\\* \\\\\\\\(n\\\\_{p}\\\\\\\\), chunks and `config.local\\\\_num\\\\_chunks\\\\_after`, \\\\*i.e.\\\\* \\\\\\\\(n\\\\_{a}\\\\\\\\), so that every input vector has at least access to \\\\\\\\(n\\\\_{p}\\\\\\\\) previous input vectors and \\\\\\\\(n\\\\_{a}\\\\\\\\) following input vectors.

It\\'s an\\nencoder-decoder transformer pre-trained in a text-to-text denoising generative setting. LongT5 model is an extension of\\nT5 model, and it enables using one of the two different efficient attention mechanisms - (1) Local attention, or (2)\\nTransient-Global attention. The abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*Recent work has shown that either (1) increasing the input length or (2) increasing model size can improve the\\nperformance of Transformer-based neural models. In this paper, we present a new model, called LongT5, with which we\\nexplore the effects of scaling both the input length and model size at the same time. Specifically, we integrated\\nattention ideas from long-input transformers (ETC), and adopted pre-training strategies from summarization pre-training\\n(PEGASUS) into the scalable T5 architecture. The result is a new attention mechanism we call {\\\\em Transient Global}\\n(TGlobal), which mimics ETC\\'s local/global attention mechanism, but without requiring additional side-inputs. We are\\nable to achieve state-of-the-art results on several summarization tasks and outperform the original T5 models on\\nquestion answering tasks.\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [stancld](https://huggingface.co/stancld). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/longt5). ## Usage tips\\n- [`LongT5ForConditionalGeneration`] is an extension of [`T5ForConditionalGeneration`] exchanging the traditional\\nencoder \\\\*self-attention\\\\* layer with efficient either \\\\*local\\\\* attention or \\\\*transient-global\\\\* (\\\\*tglobal\\\\*) attention. - Unlike the T5 model, LongT5 does not use a task prefix. Furthermore, it uses a different pre-training objective\\ninspired by the pre-training of [`PegasusForConditionalGeneration`]. - LongT5 model is designed to work efficiently and very well on long-range \\\\*sequence-to-sequence\\\\* tasks where the\\ninput sequence exceeds commonly used 512 tokens. It is capable of handling input sequences of a length up to 16,384 tokens. - For \\\\*Local Attention\\\\*, the sparse sliding-window local attention operation allows a given token to attend only `r`\\ntokens to the left and right of it (with `r=127` by default). \\\\*Local Attention\\\\* does not introduce any new parameters\\nto the model. The complexity of the mechanism is linear in input sequence length `l`: `O(l\\\\*r)`. - \\\\*Transient Global Attention\\\\* is an extension of the \\\\*Local Attention\\\\*. It, furthermore, allows each input token to\\ninteract with all other tokens in the layer. This is achieved via splitting an input sequence into blocks of a fixed\\nlength `k` (with a default `k=16`). Then, a global token for such a block is obtained via summing and normalizing the embeddings of every token\\nin the block. Thanks to this, the attention allows each token to attend to both nearby tokens like in Local attention, and\\nalso every global token like in the case of standard global attention (\\\\*transient\\\\* represents the fact the global tokens\\nare constructed dynamically within each attention operation). As a consequence, \\\\*TGlobal\\\\* attention introduces\\na few new parameters -- global relative position biases and a layer normalization for global token\\'s embedding.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689ab02f3e684812d15f64ee', 'page_content': 'summarization). The memory consumption is thus reduced from \\\\\\\\(n\\\\_s^2+ n\\\\_s n\\\\_t +n\\\\_t^2\\\\\\\\) to \\\\\\\\(w n\\\\_s +gn\\\\_s +n\\\\_s n\\\\_t +n\\\\_t^2\\\\\\\\) with \\\\\\\\(n\\\\_s\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\(n\\\\_t\\\\\\\\) being the source (encoder input) and target (decoder input) lengths respectively. For Longformer Encoder-Decoder to be efficient, it is assumed that \\\\\\\\(n\\\\_s\\\\\\\\) is much bigger than \\\\\\\\(n\\\\_t\\\\\\\\). #### Main findings\\n\\\\* The authors proposed the dilated windowed self-attention (Figure c) and showed that it yields better results on language modeling compared to just windowed/sparse self-attention (Figure b). The window sizes are increased through the layers. This pattern further outperforms previous architectures (such as Transformer-XL, or adaptive span attention) on downstream benchmarks. \\\\* Global attention allows the information to flow through the whole sequence and applying the global attention to task-motivated tokens (such as the tokens of the question in QA, CLS token for sentence classification) leads to stronger performance on downstream tasks. Using this global pattern, Longformer can be successfully applied to document-level NLP tasks in the transfer learning setting.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689ab90e3e684812d15f6f60', 'page_content': 'The Authors\\' code can be found [here](https://github.com/allenai/longformer). ## Usage tips\\n- Since the Longformer is based on RoBERTa, it doesn\\'t have `token\\\\_type\\\\_ids`. You don\\'t need to indicate which\\ntoken belongs to which segment. Just separate your segments with the separation token `tokenizer.sep\\\\_token` (or\\n``). - A transformer model replacing the attention matrices by sparse matrices to go faster. Often, the local context (e.g., what are the two tokens left and right?) is enough to take action for a given token. Some preselected input tokens are still given global attention, but the attention matrix has way less parameters, resulting in a speed-up.

Note that \"locally\" and \"globally\" attending tokens are projected by different query, key and value matrices.

It is a generic, \\\\*task-first\\\\* pipeline that lets you focus on the task. The `AutoPipeline` automatically detects the correct pipeline class to use, which makes it easier to load a checkpoint for a task without knowing the specific pipeline class name. Take a look at the [AutoPipeline](../api/pipelines/auto\\\\_pipeline) reference to see which tasks are supported. Currently, it supports text-to-image, image-to-image, and inpainting. This tutorial shows you how to use an `AutoPipeline` to automatically infer the pipeline class to load for a specific task, given the pretrained weights. ## Choose an AutoPipeline for your task\\nStart by picking a checkpoint. For example, if you\\'re interested in text-to-image with the [runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5) checkpoint, use [`AutoPipelineForText2Image`]:\\n```py\\nfrom diffusers import AutoPipelineForText2Image\\nimport torch\\npipeline = AutoPipelineForText2Image.from\\\\_pretrained(\\n\"runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5\", torch\\\\_dtype=torch.float16, use\\\\_safetensors=True\\n).to(\"cuda\")\\nprompt = \"peasant and dragon combat, wood cutting style, viking era, bevel with rune\"\\nimage = pipeline(prompt, num\\\\_inference\\\\_steps=25).images[0]\\nimage\\n```\\n\\n![generated image of peasant fighting dragon in wood cutting style](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/diffusers/autopipeline-text2img.png)\\n\\nUnder the hood, [`AutoPipelineForText2Image`]:\\n1. automatically detects a `\"stable-diffusion\"` class from the [`model\\\\_index.json`](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5/blob/main/model\\\\_index.json) file\\n2. loads the corresponding text-to-image [`StableDiffusionPipeline`] based on the `\"stable-diffusion\"` class name\\nLikewise, for image-to-image, [`AutoPipelineForImage2Image`] detects a `\"stable-diffusion\"` checkpoint from the `model\\\\_index.json` file and it\\'ll load the corresponding [`StableDiffusionImg2ImgPipeline`] behind the scenes. You can also pass any additional arguments specific to the pipeline class such as `strength`, which determines the amount of noise or variation added to an input image:\\n```py\\nfrom diffusers import AutoPipelineForImage2Image\\nimport torch\\nimport requests\\nfrom PIL import Image\\nfrom io import BytesIO\\npipeline = AutoPipelineForImage2Image.from\\\\_pretrained(\\n\"runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5\",\\ntorch\\\\_dtype=torch.float16,\\nuse\\\\_safetensors=True,\\n).to(\"cuda\")\\nprompt = \"a portrait of a dog wearing a pearl earring\"\\nurl = \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/1665\\\\_Girl\\\\_with\\\\_a\\\\_Pearl\\\\_Earring.jpg/800px-1665\\\\_Girl\\\\_with\\\\_a\\\\_Pearl\\\\_Earring.jpg\"\\nresponse = requests.get(url)\\nimage = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content)).convert(\"RGB\")\\nimage.thumbnail((768, 768))\\nimage = pipeline(prompt, image, num\\\\_inference\\\\_steps=200, strength=0.75, guidance\\\\_scale=10.5).images[0]\\nimage\\n```\\n\\n![generated image of a vermeer portrait of a dog wearing a pearl earring](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/diffusers/autopipeline-img2img.png)\\n\\nAnd if you want to do inpainting, then [`AutoPipelineForInpainting`] loads the underlying [`StableDiffusionInpaintPipeline`] class in the same way:\\n```py\\nfrom diffusers import AutoPipelineForInpainting\\nfrom diffusers.utils import load\\\\_image\\nimport torch\\npipeline = AutoPipelineForInpainting.from\\\\_pretrained(\\n\"stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0\", torch\\\\_dtype=torch.float16, use\\\\_safetensors=True\\n).to(\"cuda\")\\nimg\\\\_url = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion/main/data/inpainting\\\\_examples/overture-creations-5sI6fQgYIuo.png\"\\nmask\\\\_url = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion/main/data/inpainting\\\\_examples/overture-creations-5sI6fQgYIuo\\\\_mask.png\"\\ninit\\\\_image = load\\\\_image(img\\\\_url).convert(\"RGB\")\\nmask\\\\_image = load\\\\_image(mask\\\\_url).convert(\"RGB\")\\nprompt = \"A majestic tiger sitting on a bench\"\\nimage = pipeline(prompt, image=init\\\\_image, mask\\\\_image=mask\\\\_image, num\\\\_inference\\\\_steps=50, strength=0.80).images[0]\\nimage\\n```\\n\\n![generated image of a tiger sitting on a bench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/diffusers/autopipeline-inpaint.png)\\n\\nIf you try to load an unsupported checkpoint, it\\'ll throw an error:\\n```py\\nfrom diffusers import AutoPipelineForImage2Image\\nimport torch\\npipeline = AutoPipelineForImage2Image.from\\\\_pretrained(\\n\"openai/shap-e-img2img\", torch\\\\_dtype=torch.float16, use\\\\_safetensors=True\\n)\\n\"ValueError: AutoPipeline can\\'t find a pipeline linked to ShapEImg2ImgPipeline for None\"\\n```\\n## Use multiple pipelines\\nFor some workflows or if you\\'re loading many pipelines, it is more memory-efficient to reuse the same components from a checkpoint instead of reloading them which would unnecessarily consume additional memory.\\n\\nFor example, if you\\'re using a checkpoint for text-to-image and you want to use it again for image-to-image, use the [`~AutoPipelineForImage2Image.from\\\\_pipe`] method. This method creates a new pipeline from the components of a previously loaded pipeline at no additional memory cost. The [`~AutoPipelineForImage2Image.from\\\\_pipe`] method detects the original pipeline class and maps it to the new pipeline class corresponding to the task you want to do. For example, if you load a `\"stable-diffusion\"` class pipeline for text-to-image:\\n```py\\nfrom diffusers import AutoPipelineForText2Image, AutoPipelineForImage2Image\\nimport torch\\npipeline\\\\_text2img = AutoPipelineForText2Image.from\\\\_pretrained(\\n\"runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5\", torch\\\\_dtype=torch.float16, use\\\\_safetensors=True\\n)\\nprint(type(pipeline\\\\_text2img))\\n\"\"\\n```\\nThen [`~AutoPipelineForImage2Image.from\\\\_pipe`] maps the original `\"stable-diffusion\"` pipeline class to [`StableDiffusionImg2ImgPipeline`]:\\n```py\\npipeline\\\\_img2img = AutoPipelineForImage2Image.from\\\\_pipe(pipeline\\\\_text2img)\\nprint(type(pipeline\\\\_img2img))\\n\"\"\\n```\\nIf you passed an optional argument - like disabling the safety checker - to the original pipeline, this argument is also passed on to the new pipeline:\\n```py\\nfrom diffusers import AutoPipelineForText2Image, AutoPipelineForImage2Image\\nimport torch\\npipeline\\\\_text2img = AutoPipelineForText2Image.from\\\\_pretrained(\\n\"runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5\",\\ntorch\\\\_dtype=torch.float16,\\nuse\\\\_safetensors=True,\\nrequires\\\\_safety\\\\_checker=False,\\n).to(\"cuda\")\\npipeline\\\\_img2img = AutoPipelineForImage2Image.from\\\\_pipe(pipeline\\\\_text2img)\\nprint(pipeline\\\\_img2img.config.requires\\\\_safety\\\\_checker)\\n\"False\"\\n```\\nYou can overwrite any of the arguments and even configuration from the original pipeline if you want to change the behavior of the new pipeline.

It is a generic, \\\\*task-first\\\\* pipeline that lets you focus on the task. The `AutoPipeline` automatically detects the correct pipeline class to use, which makes it easier to load a checkpoint for a task without knowing the specific pipeline class name. Take a look at the [AutoPipeline](../api/pipelines/auto\\\\_pipeline) reference to see which tasks are supported. Currently, it supports text-to-image, image-to-image, and inpainting. This tutorial shows you how to use an `AutoPipeline` to automatically infer the pipeline class to load for a specific task, given the pretrained weights. ## Choose an AutoPipeline for your task\\nStart by picking a checkpoint. For example, if you\\'re interested in text-to-image with the [runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5) checkpoint, use [`AutoPipelineForText2Image`]:\\n```py\\nfrom diffusers import AutoPipelineForText2Image\\nimport torch\\npipeline = AutoPipelineForText2Image.from\\\\_pretrained(\\n\"runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5\", torch\\\\_dtype=torch.float16, use\\\\_safetensors=True\\n).to(\"cuda\")\\nprompt = \"peasant and dragon combat, wood cutting style, viking era, bevel with rune\"\\nimage = pipeline(prompt, num\\\\_inference\\\\_steps=25).images[0]\\nimage\\n```\\n\\n![generated image of peasant fighting dragon in wood cutting style](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/diffusers/autopipeline-text2img.png)\\n\\nUnder the hood, [`AutoPipelineForText2Image`]:\\n1. automatically detects a `\"stable-diffusion\"` class from the [`model\\\\_index.json`](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5/blob/main/model\\\\_index.json) file\\n2. loads the corresponding text-to-image [`StableDiffusionPipeline`] based on the `\"stable-diffusion\"` class name\\nLikewise, for image-to-image, [`AutoPipelineForImage2Image`] detects a `\"stable-diffusion\"` checkpoint from the `model\\\\_index.json` file and it\\'ll load the corresponding [`StableDiffusionImg2ImgPipeline`] behind the scenes. You can also pass any additional arguments specific to the pipeline class such as `strength`, which determines the amount of noise or variation added to an input image:\\n```py\\nfrom diffusers import AutoPipelineForImage2Image\\nimport torch\\nimport requests\\nfrom PIL import Image\\nfrom io import BytesIO\\npipeline = AutoPipelineForImage2Image.from\\\\_pretrained(\\n\"runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5\",\\ntorch\\\\_dtype=torch.float16,\\nuse\\\\_safetensors=True,\\n).to(\"cuda\")\\nprompt = \"a portrait of a dog wearing a pearl earring\"\\nurl = \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/1665\\\\_Girl\\\\_with\\\\_a\\\\_Pearl\\\\_Earring.jpg/800px-1665\\\\_Girl\\\\_with\\\\_a\\\\_Pearl\\\\_Earring.jpg\"\\nresponse = requests.get(url)\\nimage = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content)).convert(\"RGB\")\\nimage.thumbnail((768, 768))\\nimage = pipeline(prompt, image, num\\\\_inference\\\\_steps=200, strength=0.75, guidance\\\\_scale=10.5).images[0]\\nimage\\n```\\n\\n![generated image of a vermeer portrait of a dog wearing a pearl earring](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/diffusers/autopipeline-img2img.png)\\n\\nAnd if you want to do inpainting, then [`AutoPipelineForInpainting`] loads the underlying [`StableDiffusionInpaintPipeline`] class in the same way:\\n```py\\nfrom diffusers import AutoPipelineForInpainting\\nfrom diffusers.utils import load\\\\_image\\nimport torch\\npipeline = AutoPipelineForInpainting.from\\\\_pretrained(\\n\"stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0\", torch\\\\_dtype=torch.float16, use\\\\_safetensors=True\\n).to(\"cuda\")\\nimg\\\\_url = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion/main/data/inpainting\\\\_examples/overture-creations-5sI6fQgYIuo.png\"\\nmask\\\\_url = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion/main/data/inpainting\\\\_examples/overture-creations-5sI6fQgYIuo\\\\_mask.png\"\\ninit\\\\_image = load\\\\_image(img\\\\_url).convert(\"RGB\")\\nmask\\\\_image = load\\\\_image(mask\\\\_url).convert(\"RGB\")\\nprompt = \"A majestic tiger sitting on a bench\"\\nimage = pipeline(prompt, image=init\\\\_image, mask\\\\_image=mask\\\\_image, num\\\\_inference\\\\_steps=50, strength=0.80).images[0]\\nimage\\n```\\n\\n![generated image of a tiger sitting on a bench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/diffusers/autopipeline-inpaint.png)\\n\\nIf you try to load an unsupported checkpoint, it\\'ll throw an error:\\n```py\\nfrom diffusers import AutoPipelineForImage2Image\\nimport torch\\npipeline = AutoPipelineForImage2Image.from\\\\_pretrained(\\n\"openai/shap-e-img2img\", torch\\\\_dtype=torch.float16, use\\\\_safetensors=True\\n)\\n\"ValueError: AutoPipeline can\\'t find a pipeline linked to ShapEImg2ImgPipeline for None\"\\n```\\n## Use multiple pipelines\\nFor some workflows or if you\\'re loading many pipelines, it is more memory-efficient to reuse the same components from a checkpoint instead of reloading them which would unnecessarily consume additional memory.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '6899b3c6af3d2ebb270a00ff', 'page_content': 'For example, if you\\'re using a checkpoint for text-to-image and you want to use it again for image-to-image, use the [`~AutoPipelineForImage2Image.from\\\\_pipe`] method. This method creates a new pipeline from the components of a previously loaded pipeline at no additional memory cost. The [`~AutoPipelineForImage2Image.from\\\\_pipe`] method detects the original pipeline class and maps it to the new pipeline class corresponding to the task you want to do. For example, if you load a `\"stable-diffusion\"` class pipeline for text-to-image:\\n```py\\nfrom diffusers import AutoPipelineForText2Image, AutoPipelineForImage2Image\\nimport torch\\npipeline\\\\_text2img = AutoPipelineForText2Image.from\\\\_pretrained(\\n\"runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5\", torch\\\\_dtype=torch.float16, use\\\\_safetensors=True\\n)\\nprint(type(pipeline\\\\_text2img))\\n\"\"\\n```\\nThen [`~AutoPipelineForImage2Image.from\\\\_pipe`] maps the original `\"stable-diffusion\"` pipeline class to [`StableDiffusionImg2ImgPipeline`]:\\n```py\\npipeline\\\\_img2img = AutoPipelineForImage2Image.from\\\\_pipe(pipeline\\\\_text2img)\\nprint(type(pipeline\\\\_img2img))\\n\"\"\\n```\\nIf you passed an optional argument - like disabling the safety checker - to the original pipeline, this argument is also passed on to the new pipeline:\\n```py\\nfrom diffusers import AutoPipelineForText2Image, AutoPipelineForImage2Image\\nimport torch\\npipeline\\\\_text2img = AutoPipelineForText2Image.from\\\\_pretrained(\\n\"runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5\",\\ntorch\\\\_dtype=torch.float16,\\nuse\\\\_safetensors=True,\\nrequires\\\\_safety\\\\_checker=False,\\n).to(\"cuda\")\\npipeline\\\\_img2img = AutoPipelineForImage2Image.from\\\\_pipe(pipeline\\\\_text2img)\\nprint(pipeline\\\\_img2img.config.requires\\\\_safety\\\\_checker)\\n\"False\"\\n```\\nYou can overwrite any of the arguments and even configuration from the original pipeline if you want to change the behavior of the new pipeline.

Whether you\\'re looking for a simple inference solution or want to train your own diffusion model, 🤗 Diffusers is a modular toolbox that supports both. Our library is designed with a focus on [usability over performance](conceptual/philosophy#usability-over-performance), [simple over easy](conceptual/philosophy#simple-over-easy), and [customizability over abstractions](conceptual/philosophy#tweakable-contributorfriendly-over-abstraction). The library has three main components:\\n- State-of-the-art diffusion pipelines for inference with just a few lines of code. There are many pipelines in 🤗 Diffusers, check out the table in the pipeline [overview](api/pipelines/overview) for a complete list of available pipelines and the task they solve. - Interchangeable [noise schedulers](api/schedulers/overview) for balancing trade-offs between generation speed and quality. - Pretrained [models](api/models) that can be used as building blocks, and combined with schedulers, for creating your own end-to-end diffusion systems.

Whether you\\'re looking for a simple inference solution or want to train your own diffusion model, 🤗 Diffusers is a modular toolbox that supports both. Our library is designed with a focus on [usability over performance](conceptual/philosophy#usability-over-performance), [simple over easy](conceptual/philosophy#simple-over-easy), and [customizability over abstractions](conceptual/philosophy#tweakable-contributorfriendly-over-abstraction). The library has three main components:\\n- State-of-the-art diffusion pipelines for inference with just a few lines of code. There are many pipelines in 🤗 Diffusers, check out the table in the pipeline [overview](api/pipelines/overview) for a complete list of available pipelines and the task they solve. - Interchangeable [noise schedulers](api/schedulers/overview) for balancing trade-offs between generation speed and quality. - Pretrained [models](api/models) that can be used as building blocks, and combined with schedulers, for creating your own end-to-end diffusion systems. [Tutorials\\n\\nLearn the fundamental skills you need to start generating outputs, build your own diffusion system, and train a diffusion model.

The paper aims at creating a single unified foundation model which can work across vision, language\\nas well as vision-and-language multimodal tasks. The abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*State-of-the-art vision and vision-and-language models rely on large-scale visio-linguistic pretraining for obtaining good performance on a variety\\nof downstream tasks. Generally, such models are often either cross-modal (contrastive) or multi-modal\\n(with earlier fusion) but not both; and they often only target specific modalities or tasks. A promising\\ndirection would be to use a single holistic universal model, as a \"foundation\", that targets all modalities\\nat once -- a true vision and language foundation model should be good at vision tasks, language tasks, and\\ncross- and multi-modal vision and language tasks. We introduce FLAVA as such a model and demonstrate\\nimpressive performance on a wide range of 35 tasks spanning these target modalities.\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [aps](https://huggingface.co/aps).

Let’s break this down and see how this works. Language models with a prefix objective predict the next token given an input text as the prefix. For example, given the sequence “A man is standing at the corner”, we can use “A man is standing at the” as the prefix and train the model with the objective of predicting the next token - “corner” or another plausible continuation of the prefix. Visual transformers (ViT) apply the same concept of the prefix to images by dividing each image into a number of patches and sequentially feeding these patches to the model as inputs. Leveraging this idea, SimVLM features an architecture where the encoder receives a concatenated image patch sequence and prefix text sequence as the prefix input, and the decoder then predicts the continuation of the textual sequence. The diagram above depicts this idea. The SimVLM model is first pre-trained on a text dataset without image patches present in the prefix and then on an aligned image-text dataset. These models are used for image-conditioned text generation/captioning and VQA tasks. Models that leverage a unified multi-modal architecture to fuse visual information into a language model (LM) for image-guided tasks show impressive capabilities. However, models that solely use the PrefixLM strategy can be limited in terms of application areas as they are mainly designed for image captioning or visual question-answering downstream tasks. For example, given an image of a group of people, we can query the image to write a description of the image (e.g., “A group of people is standing together in front of a building and smiling”) or query it with questions that require visual reasoning: “How many people are wearing red t-shirts?”. On the other hand, models that learn multi-modal representations or adopt hybrid approaches can be adapted for various other downstream tasks, such as object detection and image segmentation. #### Frozen PrefixLM\\n\\n![Frozen PrefixLM](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/128_vision_language_pretraining/frozen_prefixlm.png)  \\n*Frozen PrefixLM pre-training strategy ([image source](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2022-06-09-vlm))*\\n\\nWhile fusing visual information into a language model is highly effective, being able to use a pre-trained language model (LM) without the need for fine-tuning would be much more efficient.

Models such as [Frozen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13884) and [ClipCap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09734) use this Frozen PrefixLM pre-training objective.

The paper aims at creating a single unified foundation model which can work across vision, language\\nas well as vision-and-language multimodal tasks. The abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*State-of-the-art vision and vision-and-language models rely on large-scale visio-linguistic pretraining for obtaining good performance on a variety\\nof downstream tasks. Generally, such models are often either cross-modal (contrastive) or multi-modal\\n(with earlier fusion) but not both; and they often only target specific modalities or tasks. A promising\\ndirection would be to use a single holistic universal model, as a \"foundation\", that targets all modalities\\nat once -- a true vision and language foundation model should be good at vision tasks, language tasks, and\\ncross- and multi-modal vision and language tasks. We introduce FLAVA as such a model and demonstrate\\nimpressive performance on a wide range of 35 tasks spanning these target modalities.\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [aps](https://huggingface.co/aps).

To leverage these representations for image generation, we propose a two-stage model: a prior that generates a CLIP image embedding given a text caption, and a decoder that generates an image conditioned on the image embedding. We show that explicitly generating image representations improves image diversity with minimal loss in photorealism and caption similarity. Our decoders conditioned on image representations can also produce variations of an image that preserve both its semantics and style, while varying the non-essential details absent from the image representation. Moreover, the joint embedding space of CLIP enables language-guided image manipulations in a zero-shot fashion. We use diffusion models for the decoder and experiment with both autoregressive and diffusion models for the prior, finding that the latter are computationally more efficient and produce higher-quality samples.\\\\*\\nYou can find lucidrains\\' DALL-E 2 recreation at [lucidrains/DALLE2-pytorch](https://github.com/lucidrains/DALLE2-pytorch).

To ensure the first word includes a space, we set `add\\\\_prefix\\\\_space=True`. Also, to maintain consistent pre-processing for all three models, we set the parameter to \\'True\\' for Llama 2 and Mistral 7b. - Define the preprocessing function for converting one row of the dataframe:\\n```python\\ndef roberta\\\\_preprocessing\\\\_function(examples):\\nreturn roberta\\\\_tokenizer(examples[\\'text\\'], truncation=True, max\\\\_length=MAX\\\\_LEN)\\n```\\nBy applying the preprocessing function to the first example of our training dataset, we have the tokenized inputs (`input\\\\_ids`) and the attention mask:\\n```python\\nroberta\\\\_preprocessing\\\\_function(data[\\'train\\'][0])\\n```\\n```\\n{\\'input\\\\_ids\\': [0, 127, 2373, 2490, 4, 1205, 640, 90, 4, 876, 73, 118, 725, 398, 13083, 329, 398, 119, 1343, 246, 2], \\'attention\\\\_mask\\': [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\\n```\\n- Now, let\\'s apply the preprocessing function to the entire dataset:\\n```python\\ncol\\\\_to\\\\_delete = [\\'id\\', \\'keyword\\',\\'location\\', \\'text\\']\\n# Apply the preprocessing function and remove the undesired columns\\nroberta\\\\_tokenized\\\\_datasets = data.map(roberta\\\\_preprocessing\\\\_function, batched=True, remove\\\\_columns=col\\\\_to\\\\_delete)\\n# Rename the target to label as for HugginFace standards\\nroberta\\\\_tokenized\\\\_datasets = roberta\\\\_tokenized\\\\_datasets.rename\\\\_column(\"target\", \"label\")\\n# Set to torch format\\nroberta\\\\_tokenized\\\\_datasets.set\\\\_format(\"torch\")\\n```\\n\\\\*\\\\*Note:\\\\*\\\\* we deleted the undesired columns from our data: id, keyword, location and text. We have deleted the text because we have already converted it into the inputs ids and the attention mask:\\nWe can have a look into our tokenized training dataset:\\n```python\\nroberta\\\\_tokenized\\\\_datasets[\\'train\\'][0]\\n```\\n```\\n{\\'label\\': tensor(0),\\n\\'input\\\\_ids\\': tensor([ 0, 127, 2373, 2490, 4, 1205, 640, 90, 4, 876,\\n73, 118, 725, 398, 13083, 329, 398, 119, 1343, 246,\\n2]),\\n\\'attention\\\\_mask\\': tensor([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1])}\\n```\\n- For generating the training batches, we also need to pad the rows of a given batch to the maximum length found in the batch. For that, we will use the `DataCollatorWithPadding` class:\\n```python\\n# Data collator for padding a batch of examples to the maximum length seen in the batch\\nfrom transformers import DataCollatorWithPadding\\nroberta\\\\_data\\\\_collator = DataCollatorWithPadding(tokenizer=roberta\\\\_tokenizer)\\n```\\nYou can follow the same steps for preparing the data for Mistral 7B and Llama 2 models:\\n\\\\*\\\\*Note\\\\*\\\\* that Llama 2 and Mistral 7B don\\'t have a default `pad\\\\_token\\\\_id`. So, we use the `eos\\\\_token\\\\_id` for padding as well. - Mistral 7B:\\n```python\\n# Load Mistral 7B Tokenizer\\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, DataCollatorWithPadding\\nmistral\\\\_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from\\\\_pretrained(mistral\\\\_checkpoint, add\\\\_prefix\\\\_space=True)\\nmistral\\\\_tokenizer.pad\\\\_token\\\\_id = mistral\\\\_tokenizer.eos\\\\_token\\\\_id\\nmistral\\\\_tokenizer.pad\\\\_token = mistral\\\\_tokenizer.eos\\\\_token\\ndef mistral\\\\_preprocessing\\\\_function(examples):\\nreturn mistral\\\\_tokenizer(examples[\\'text\\'], truncation=True, max\\\\_length=MAX\\\\_LEN)\\nmistral\\\\_tokenized\\\\_datasets = data.map(mistral\\\\_preprocessing\\\\_function, batched=True, remove\\\\_columns=col\\\\_to\\\\_delete)\\nmistral\\\\_tokenized\\\\_datasets = mistral\\\\_tokenized\\\\_datasets.rename\\\\_column(\"target\", \"label\")\\nmistral\\\\_tokenized\\\\_datasets.set\\\\_format(\"torch\")\\n# Data collator for padding a batch of examples to the maximum length seen in the batch\\nmistral\\\\_data\\\\_collator = DataCollatorWithPadding(tokenizer=mistral\\\\_tokenizer)\\n```\\n- Llama 2:\\n```python\\n# Load Llama 2 Tokenizer\\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, DataCollatorWithPadding\\nllama\\\\_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from\\\\_pretrained(llama\\\\_checkpoint, add\\\\_prefix\\\\_space=True)\\nllama\\\\_tokenizer.pad\\\\_token\\\\_id = llama\\\\_tokenizer.eos\\\\_token\\\\_id\\nllama\\\\_tokenizer.pad\\\\_token = llama\\\\_tokenizer.eos\\\\_token\\ndef llama\\\\_preprocessing\\\\_function(examples):\\nreturn llama\\\\_tokenizer(examples[\\'text\\'], truncation=True, max\\\\_length=MAX\\\\_LEN)\\nllama\\\\_tokenized\\\\_datasets = data.map(llama\\\\_preprocessing\\\\_function, batched=True, remove\\\\_columns=col\\\\_to\\\\_delete)\\nllama\\\\_tokenized\\\\_datasets = llama\\\\_tokenized\\\\_datasets.rename\\\\_column(\"target\", \"label\")\\nllama\\\\_tokenized\\\\_datasets.set\\\\_format(\"torch\")\\n# Data collator for padding a batch of examples to the maximum length seen in the batch\\nllama\\\\_data\\\\_collator = DataCollatorWithPadding(tokenizer=llama\\\\_tokenizer)\\n```\\nNow that we have prepared the tokenized datasets, the next section will showcase how to load the pre-trained LLMs checkpoints and how to set the LoRa weights. ## Models\\n### RoBERTa\\n#### Load RoBERTa Checkpoints for the Classification Task\\nWe load the pre-trained RoBERTa model with a sequence classification head using the Hugging Face `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` class:\\n```python\\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification\\nroberta\\\\_model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from\\\\_pretrained(roberta\\\\_checkpoint, num\\\\_labels=2)\\n```\\n#### LoRA setup for RoBERTa classifier\\nWe import LoRa configuration and set some parameters for RoBERTa classifier:\\n- TaskType: Sequence classification\\n- r(rank): Rank for our decomposition matrices\\n- lora\\\\_alpha: Alpha parameter to scale the learned weights.\\n\\nIts primary objective is to reduce the model\\'s trainable parameters.

With a simple HTTP request, you can load any hub model and predict your data with it in seconds. The model URL and a valid hub token are all you need.

To address these problems, we present two parameter-reduction\\ntechniques to lower memory consumption and increase the training speed of BERT. Comprehensive empirical evidence shows\\nthat our proposed methods lead to models that scale much better compared to the original BERT. We also use a\\nself-supervised loss that focuses on modeling inter-sentence coherence, and show it consistently helps downstream tasks\\nwith multi-sentence inputs. As a result, our best model establishes new state-of-the-art results on the GLUE, RACE, and\\nSQuAD benchmarks while having fewer parameters compared to BERT-large.\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [lysandre](https://huggingface.co/lysandre). This model jax version was contributed by\\n[kamalkraj](https://huggingface.co/kamalkraj). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/ALBERT). ## Usage tips\\n- ALBERT is a model with absolute position embeddings so it\\'s usually advised to pad the inputs on the right rather\\nthan the left. - ALBERT uses repeating layers which results in a small memory footprint, however the computational cost remains\\nsimilar to a BERT-like architecture with the same number of hidden layers as it has to iterate through the same\\nnumber of (repeating) layers. - Embedding size E is different from hidden size H justified because the embeddings are context independent (one embedding vector represents one token), whereas hidden states are context dependent (one hidden state represents a sequence of tokens) so it\\'s more logical to have H >> E. Also, the embedding matrix is large since it\\'s V x E (V being the vocab size). If E < H, it has less parameters. - Layers are split in groups that share parameters (to save memory). Next sentence prediction is replaced by a sentence ordering prediction: in the inputs, we have two sentences A and B (that are consecutive) and we either feed A followed by B or B followed by A.\\n\\n!--Copyright 2020 The HuggingFace Team.

To address these problems, we present two parameter-reduction\\ntechniques to lower memory consumption and increase the training speed of BERT. Comprehensive empirical evidence shows\\nthat our proposed methods lead to models that scale much better compared to the original BERT. We also use a\\nself-supervised loss that focuses on modeling inter-sentence coherence, and show it consistently helps downstream tasks\\nwith multi-sentence inputs. As a result, our best model establishes new state-of-the-art results on the GLUE, RACE, and\\nSQuAD benchmarks while having fewer parameters compared to BERT-large.\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [lysandre](https://huggingface.co/lysandre).

The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/ALBERT). ## Usage tips\\n- ALBERT is a model with absolute position embeddings so it's usually advised to pad the inputs on the right rather\\nthan the left. - ALBERT uses repeating layers which results in a small memory footprint, however the computational cost remains\\nsimilar to a BERT-like architecture with the same number of hidden layers as it has to iterate through the same\\nnumber of (repeating) layers. - Embedding size E is different from hidden size H justified because the embeddings are context independent (one embedding vector represents one token), whereas hidden states are context dependent (one hidden state represents a sequence of tokens) so it's more logical to have H >> E. Also, the embedding matrix is large since it's V x E (V being the vocab size). If E < H, it has less parameters. - Layers are split in groups that share parameters (to save memory). Next sentence prediction is replaced by a sentence ordering prediction: in the inputs, we have two sentences A and B (that are consecutive) and we either feed A followed by B or B followed by A.\", 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689aa7fd3e684812d15f5b79', 'page_content': '!--Copyright 2020 The HuggingFace Team.

[ALBERT](model\\\\_doc/albert) reduces memory consumption by lowering the number of parameters in two ways: separating the larger vocabulary embedding into two smaller matrices and allowing layers to share parameters. [DeBERTa](model\\\\_doc/deberta) added a disentangled attention mechanism where the word and its position are separately encoded in two vectors. The attention is computed from these separate vectors instead of a single vector containing the word and position embeddings. [Longformer](model\\\\_doc/longformer) also focused on making attention more efficient, especially for processing documents with longer sequence lengths. It uses a combination of local windowed attention (attention only calculated from fixed window size around each token) and global attention (only for specific task tokens like `[CLS]` for classification) to create a sparse attention matrix instead of a full attention matrix. ### Decoder[[nlp-decoder]]\\n[GPT-2](model\\\\_doc/gpt2) is a decoder-only Transformer that predicts the next word in the sequence.\\n\\n- [Question answering](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter7/7?fw=pt) chapter of the 🤗 Hugging Face Course. - Check the [Question answering task guide](../tasks/question\\\\_answering) on how to use the model. \\\\*\\\\*Multiple choice\\\\*\\\\*\\n- [`AlbertForMultipleChoice`] is supported by this [example script](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/pytorch/multiple-choice) and [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/multiple\\\\_choice.ipynb). - [`TFAlbertForMultipleChoice`] is supported by this [example script](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/tensorflow/multiple-choice) and [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/multiple\\\\_choice-tf.ipynb). - Check the [Multiple choice task guide](../tasks/multiple\\\\_choice) on how to use the model. ## AlbertConfig\\n[[autodoc]] AlbertConfig\\n## AlbertTokenizer\\n[[autodoc]] AlbertTokenizer\\n- build\\\\_inputs\\\\_with\\\\_special\\\\_tokens\\n- get\\\\_special\\\\_tokens\\\\_mask\\n- create\\\\_token\\\\_type\\\\_ids\\\\_from\\\\_sequences\\n- save\\\\_vocabulary\\n## AlbertTokenizerFast\\n[[autodoc]] AlbertTokenizerFast\\n## Albert specific outputs\\n[[autodoc]] models.albert.modeling\\\\_albert.AlbertForPreTrainingOutput\\n[[autodoc]] models.albert.modeling\\\\_tf\\\\_albert.TFAlbertForPreTrainingOutput\\n\\n## AlbertModel\\n[[autodoc]] AlbertModel\\n- forward\\n## AlbertForPreTraining\\n[[autodoc]] AlbertForPreTraining\\n- forward\\n## AlbertForMaskedLM\\n[[autodoc]] AlbertForMaskedLM\\n- forward\\n## AlbertForSequenceClassification\\n[[autodoc]] AlbertForSequenceClassification\\n- forward\\n## AlbertForMultipleChoice\\n[[autodoc]] AlbertForMultipleChoice\\n## AlbertForTokenClassification\\n[[autodoc]] AlbertForTokenClassification\\n- forward\\n## AlbertForQuestionAnswering\\n[[autodoc]] AlbertForQuestionAnswering\\n- forward\\n\\n## TFAlbertModel\\n[[autodoc]] TFAlbertModel\\n- call\\n## TFAlbertForPreTraining\\n[[autodoc]] TFAlbertForPreTraining\\n- call\\n## TFAlbertForMaskedLM\\n[[autodoc]] TFAlbertForMaskedLM\\n- call\\n## TFAlbertForSequenceClassification\\n[[autodoc]] TFAlbertForSequenceClassification\\n- call\\n## TFAlbertForMultipleChoice\\n[[autodoc]] TFAlbertForMultipleChoice\\n- call\\n## TFAlbertForTokenClassification\\n[[autodoc]] TFAlbertForTokenClassification\\n- call\\n## TFAlbertForQuestionAnswering\\n[[autodoc]] TFAlbertForQuestionAnswering\\n- call\\n\\n## FlaxAlbertModel\\n[[autodoc]] FlaxAlbertModel\\n- \\\\_\\\\_call\\\\_\\\\_\\n## FlaxAlbertForPreTraining\\n[[autodoc]] FlaxAlbertForPreTraining\\n- \\\\_\\\\_call\\\\_\\\\_\\n## FlaxAlbertForMaskedLM\\n[[autodoc]] FlaxAlbertForMaskedLM\\n- \\\\_\\\\_call\\\\_\\\\_\\n## FlaxAlbertForSequenceClassification\\n[[autodoc]] FlaxAlbertForSequenceClassification\\n- \\\\_\\\\_call\\\\_\\\\_\\n## FlaxAlbertForMultipleChoice\\n[[autodoc]] FlaxAlbertForMultipleChoice\\n- \\\\_\\\\_call\\\\_\\\\_\\n## FlaxAlbertForTokenClassification\\n[[autodoc]] FlaxAlbertForTokenClassification\\n- \\\\_\\\\_call\\\\_\\\\_\\n## FlaxAlbertForQuestionAnswering\\n[[autodoc]] FlaxAlbertForQuestionAnswering\\n- \\\\_\\\\_call\\\\_\\\\_', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': '7e10d75e-2ee1-461d-a905-5d9ef0e7a9ca', 'tool_call_id': 'call_xQh2AgwfByjPU2KLEtIQmmDf', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689ab3d33e684812d15f692e', 'page_content': \"It presents two parameter-reduction techniques to lower memory consumption and increase the training\\nspeed of BERT:\\n- Splitting the embedding matrix into two smaller matrices. - Using repeating layers split among groups.

[ALBERT](model\\\\_doc/albert) reduces memory consumption by lowering the number of parameters in two ways: separating the larger vocabulary embedding into two smaller matrices and allowing layers to share parameters. [DeBERTa](model\\\\_doc/deberta) added a disentangled attention mechanism where the word and its position are separately encoded in two vectors. The attention is computed from these separate vectors instead of a single vector containing the word and position embeddings. [Longformer](model\\\\_doc/longformer) also focused on making attention more efficient, especially for processing documents with longer sequence lengths. It uses a combination of local windowed attention (attention only calculated from fixed window size around each token) and global attention (only for specific task tokens like `[CLS]` for classification) to create a sparse attention matrix instead of a full attention matrix. ### Decoder[[nlp-decoder]]\\n[GPT-2](model\\\\_doc/gpt2) is a decoder-only Transformer that predicts the next word in the sequence.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689ab3d33e684812d15f6931', 'page_content': '- [Question answering](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter7/7?fw=pt) chapter of the 🤗 Hugging Face Course. - Check the [Question answering task guide](../tasks/question\\\\_answering) on how to use the model. \\\\*\\\\*Multiple choice\\\\*\\\\*\\n- [`AlbertForMultipleChoice`] is supported by this [example script](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/pytorch/multiple-choice) and [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/multiple\\\\_choice.ipynb). - [`TFAlbertForMultipleChoice`] is supported by this [example script](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/tensorflow/multiple-choice) and [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/multiple\\\\_choice-tf.ipynb). - Check the [Multiple choice task guide](../tasks/multiple\\\\_choice) on how to use the model. ## AlbertConfig\\n[[autodoc]] AlbertConfig\\n## AlbertTokenizer\\n[[autodoc]] AlbertTokenizer\\n- build\\\\_inputs\\\\_with\\\\_special\\\\_tokens\\n- get\\\\_special\\\\_tokens\\\\_mask\\n- create\\\\_token\\\\_type\\\\_ids\\\\_from\\\\_sequences\\n- save\\\\_vocabulary\\n## AlbertTokenizerFast\\n[[autodoc]] AlbertTokenizerFast\\n## Albert specific outputs\\n[[autodoc]] models.albert.modeling\\\\_albert.AlbertForPreTrainingOutput\\n[[autodoc]] models.albert.modeling\\\\_tf\\\\_albert.TFAlbertForPreTrainingOutput\\n\\n## AlbertModel\\n[[autodoc]] AlbertModel\\n- forward\\n## AlbertForPreTraining\\n[[autodoc]] AlbertForPreTraining\\n- forward\\n## AlbertForMaskedLM\\n[[autodoc]] AlbertForMaskedLM\\n- forward\\n## AlbertForSequenceClassification\\n[[autodoc]] AlbertForSequenceClassification\\n- forward\\n## AlbertForMultipleChoice\\n[[autodoc]] AlbertForMultipleChoice\\n## AlbertForTokenClassification\\n[[autodoc]] AlbertForTokenClassification\\n- forward\\n## AlbertForQuestionAnswering\\n[[autodoc]] AlbertForQuestionAnswering\\n- forward\\n\\n## TFAlbertModel\\n[[autodoc]] TFAlbertModel\\n- call\\n## TFAlbertForPreTraining\\n[[autodoc]] TFAlbertForPreTraining\\n- call\\n## TFAlbertForMaskedLM\\n[[autodoc]] TFAlbertForMaskedLM\\n- call\\n## TFAlbertForSequenceClassification\\n[[autodoc]] TFAlbertForSequenceClassification\\n- call\\n## TFAlbertForMultipleChoice\\n[[autodoc]] TFAlbertForMultipleChoice\\n- call\\n## TFAlbertForTokenClassification\\n[[autodoc]] TFAlbertForTokenClassification\\n- call\\n## TFAlbertForQuestionAnswering\\n[[autodoc]] TFAlbertForQuestionAnswering\\n- call\\n\\n## FlaxAlbertModel\\n[[autodoc]] FlaxAlbertModel\\n- \\\\_\\\\_call\\\\_\\\\_\\n## FlaxAlbertForPreTraining\\n[[autodoc]] FlaxAlbertForPreTraining\\n- \\\\_\\\\_call\\\\_\\\\_\\n## FlaxAlbertForMaskedLM\\n[[autodoc]] FlaxAlbertForMaskedLM\\n- \\\\_\\\\_call\\\\_\\\\_\\n## FlaxAlbertForSequenceClassification\\n[[autodoc]] FlaxAlbertForSequenceClassification\\n- \\\\_\\\\_call\\\\_\\\\_\\n## FlaxAlbertForMultipleChoice\\n[[autodoc]] FlaxAlbertForMultipleChoice\\n- \\\\_\\\\_call\\\\_\\\\_\\n## FlaxAlbertForTokenClassification\\n[[autodoc]] FlaxAlbertForTokenClassification\\n- \\\\_\\\\_call\\\\_\\\\_\\n## FlaxAlbertForQuestionAnswering\\n[[autodoc]] FlaxAlbertForQuestionAnswering\\n- \\\\_\\\\_call\\\\_\\\\_', 'type': 'Document'}}], 'status': 'success'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'messages', 'AIMessage'], 'kwargs': {'content': 'The two parameter-reduction techniques proposed in the ALBERT model to lower memory consumption and increase training speed are:\\n\\n1.

We created a detailed benchmark with over 190 different configurations sharing the results you can expect when using Hugging Face Infinity on CPU, what would be the best configuration to optimize your Infinity Container for latency, and what would be the best configuration to maximize throughput. Hugging Face Infinity can deliver up to 800% higher throughput compared to vanilla transformers, and down to 1-4ms latency for sequence lengths up to 64 tokens. The flexibility to optimize transformer models for throughput, latency, or both enables businesses to either reduce the amount of infrastructure cost for the same workload or to enable real-time use cases that were not possible before.

To deploy and accelerate your models, we recommend the following new solutions:\\n\\\\* [Inference Endpoints](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-endpoints/index) to easily deploy models on dedicated infrastructure managed by Hugging Face. \\\\* Our open-source optimization libraries, [🤗 Optimum Intel](https://huggingface.co/blog/openvino) and [🤗 Optimum ONNX Runtime](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/main/en/onnxruntime/overview), to get the highest efficiency out of training and running models for inference. \\\\* Hugging Face [Expert Acceleration Program](https://huggingface.co/support), a commercial service for Hugging Face experts to work directly with your team to accelerate your Machine Learning roadmap and models. ## Introduction\\nTransfer learning has changed Machine Learning by reaching new levels of accuracy from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to Audio and Computer Vision tasks. At Hugging Face, we work hard to make these new complex models and large checkpoints as easily accessible and usable as possible. But while researchers and data scientists have converted to the new world of Transformers, few companies have been able to deploy these large, complex models in production at scale. The main bottleneck is the latency of predictions which can make large deployments expensive to run and real-time use cases impractical. Solving this is a difficult engineering challenge for any Machine Learning Engineering team and requires the use of advanced techniques to optimize models all the way down to the hardware. With [Hugging Face Infinity](https://huggingface.co/infinity), we offer a containerized solution that makes it easy to deploy low-latency, high-throughput, hardware-accelerated inference pipelines for the most popular Transformer models. Companies can get both the accuracy of Transformers and the efficiency necessary for large volume deployments, all in a simple to use package. In this blog post, we want to share detailed performance results for Infinity running on the latest generation of Intel Xeon CPU, to achieve optimal cost, efficiency, and latency for your Transformer deployments. ## What is Hugging Face Infinity\\nHugging Face Infinity is a containerized solution for customers to deploy end-to-end optimized inference pipelines for State-of-the-Art Transformer models, on any infrastructure. Hugging Face Infinity consists of 2 main services:\\n\\\\* The Infinity Container is a hardware-optimized inference solution delivered as a Docker container. \\\\* Infinity Multiverse is a Model Optimization Service through which a Hugging Face Transformer model is optimized for the Target Hardware. Infinity Multiverse is compatible with Infinity Container.

With over 5,000 pre-trained and fine-tuned models available, in over 250 languages, it is a rich playground, easily accessible whichever framework you are working in. While experimenting with models in 🤗 Transformers is easy, deploying these large models into production with maximum performance, and managing them into an architecture that scales with usage is a \\\\*\\\\*hard engineering challenge\\\\*\\\\* for any Machine Learning Engineer. This 100x performance gain and built-in scalability is why subscribers of our hosted [Accelerated Inference API](https://huggingface.co/pricing) chose to build their NLP features on top of it.

This post shares some of our approaches squeezing every drop of compute juice for our customers. 🍋\\n## Getting to the first 10x speedup\\nThe first leg of the optimization journey is the most accessible, all about using the best combination of techniques offered by the [Hugging Face libraries](https://github.com/huggingface/), independent of the target hardware. We use the most efficient methods built into Hugging Face model [pipelines](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main\\\\_classes/pipelines.html) to reduce the amount of computation during each forward pass. These methods are specific to the architecture of the model and the target task, for instance for a text-generation task on a GPT architecture, we reduce the dimensionality of the attention matrices computation by focusing on the new attention of the last token in each pass:\\n-| Naive version | Optimized version |\\n-|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|\\n-|![](/blog/assets/09\\\\_accelerated\\\\_inference/unoptimized\\\\_graph.png)|![](/blog/assets/09\\\\_accelerated\\\\_inference/optimized\\\\_graph.png)|\\nTokenization is often a bottleneck for efficiency during inference. We use the most efficient methods from the [🤗 Tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/) library, leveraging the Rust implementation of the model tokenizer in combination with smart caching to get up to 10x speedup for the overall latency. Leveraging the latest features of the Hugging Face libraries, we achieve a reliable 10x speed up compared to an out-of-box deployment for a given model/hardware pair. As new releases of Transformers and Tokenizers typically ship every month, our API customers do not need to constantly adapt to new optimization opportunities, their models just keep running faster.', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': '2ac3123f-1f89-45f4-b108-597920c45c8b', 'tool_call_id': 'call_Acx2ZyDCxmWIjP3aLIpyDgQJ', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689ab7f83e684812d15f6e43', 'page_content': 'It is remarkable to see how robust and constant Infinity is, with minimal deviation for p95, p99, or p100 (max latency).

We created a detailed benchmark with over 190 different configurations sharing the results you can expect when using Hugging Face Infinity on CPU, what would be the best configuration to optimize your Infinity Container for latency, and what would be the best configuration to maximize throughput. Hugging Face Infinity can deliver up to 800% higher throughput compared to vanilla transformers, and down to 1-4ms latency for sequence lengths up to 64 tokens. The flexibility to optimize transformer models for throughput, latency, or both enables businesses to either reduce the amount of infrastructure cost for the same workload or to enable real-time use cases that were not possible before.

At Hugging Face, we work hard to make these new complex models and large checkpoints as easily accessible and usable as possible. But while researchers and data scientists have converted to the new world of Transformers, few companies have been able to deploy these large, complex models in production at scale. The main bottleneck is the latency of predictions which can make large deployments expensive to run and real-time use cases impractical. Solving this is a difficult engineering challenge for any Machine Learning Engineering team and requires the use of advanced techniques to optimize models all the way down to the hardware. With [Hugging Face Infinity](https://huggingface.co/infinity), we offer a containerized solution that makes it easy to deploy low-latency, high-throughput, hardware-accelerated inference pipelines for the most popular Transformer models. Companies can get both the accuracy of Transformers and the efficiency necessary for large volume deployments, all in a simple to use package. In this blog post, we want to share detailed performance results for Infinity running on the latest generation of Intel Xeon CPU, to achieve optimal cost, efficiency, and latency for your Transformer deployments. ## What is Hugging Face Infinity\\nHugging Face Infinity is a containerized solution for customers to deploy end-to-end optimized inference pipelines for State-of-the-Art Transformer models, on any infrastructure. Hugging Face Infinity consists of 2 main services:\\n\\\\* The Infinity Container is a hardware-optimized inference solution delivered as a Docker container. \\\\* Infinity Multiverse is a Model Optimization Service through which a Hugging Face Transformer model is optimized for the Target Hardware. Infinity Multiverse is compatible with Infinity Container. The Infinity Container is built specifically to run on a Target Hardware architecture and exposes an HTTP /predict endpoint to run inference. Figure 1.

Their success can be attributed to the self-attention mechanism, which captures the pairwise interactions between all the tokens in an input. However, the standard self-attention mechanism has a time and memory complexity of \\\\\\\\(O(n^2)\\\\\\\\) (where \\\\\\\\(n\\\\\\\\) is the length of the input sequence), making it expensive to train on long input sequences. The [Nyströmformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03902) is one of many efficient Transformer models that approximates standard self-attention with \\\\\\\\(O(n)\\\\\\\\) complexity. Nyströmformer exhibits competitive performance on various downstream NLP and CV tasks while improving upon the efficiency of standard self-attention. The aim of this blog post is to give readers an overview of the Nyström method and how it can be adapted to approximate self-attention. ## Nyström method for matrix approximation\\nAt the heart of Nyströmformer is the Nyström method for matrix approximation. It allows us to approximate a matrix by sampling some of its rows and columns. Let\\'s consider a matrix \\\\\\\\(P^{n \\\\times n}\\\\\\\\), which is expensive to compute in its entirety. So, instead, we approximate it using the Nyström method. We start by sampling \\\\\\\\(m\\\\\\\\) rows and columns from \\\\\\\\(P\\\\\\\\). We can then arrange the sampled rows and columns as follows:\\n\\nRepresenting P as a block matrix\\n\\nWe now have four submatrices: \\\\\\\\(A\\\\_P, B\\\\_P, F\\\\_P,\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\(C\\\\_P\\\\\\\\), with sizes \\\\\\\\(m \\\\times m, m \\\\times (n - m), (n - m) \\\\times m\\\\\\\\) and\\n\\\\\\\\((n - m) \\\\times (n - m)\\\\\\\\) respectively. The \\\\\\\\(m\\\\\\\\) sampled columns are contained in \\\\\\\\(A\\\\_P\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\(F\\\\_P\\\\\\\\), whereas the \\\\\\\\(m\\\\\\\\) sampled rows are contained in \\\\\\\\(A\\\\_P\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\(B\\\\_P\\\\\\\\). So, the entries of \\\\\\\\(A\\\\_P, B\\\\_P,\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\(F\\\\_P\\\\\\\\) are known to us, and we will estimate \\\\\\\\(C\\\\_P\\\\\\\\). According to the Nyström method, \\\\\\\\(C\\\\_P\\\\\\\\) is given by:\\n$$C\\\\_P = F\\\\_P A\\\\_P^+ B\\\\_P$$\\nHere, \\\\\\\\(+\\\\\\\\) denotes the Moore-Penrose inverse (or pseudoinverse). Thus, the Nyström approximation of \\\\\\\\(P, \\\\hat{P}\\\\\\\\) can be written as:\\n\\nNyström approximation of P\\n\\nAs shown in the second line, \\\\\\\\(\\\\hat{P}\\\\\\\\) can be expressed as a product of three matrices.\\n\\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*Transformers have emerged as a powerful tool for a broad range of natural language processing tasks. A key component\\nthat drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or\\ndependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the\\ninput sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences -- a topic being actively studied in the\\ncommunity. To address this limitation, we propose Nyströmformer -- a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a\\nfunction of sequence length.

The scalability of Nyströmformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of\\ntokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard\\nsequence length, and find that our Nyströmformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than\\nstandard self-attention.

CLIPSeg adds a minimal decoder on top of a frozen [CLIP](clip) model for zero- and one-shot image segmentation.\\n\\nNow you see why CLIP was truly a breakthrough in machine learning. The reason why CLIP works so well is that the model was trained on a huge dataset of images with text captions. The dataset contained a whopping 400 million image-text pairs taken from the internet. These images contain a wide variety of objects and concepts, and CLIP is great at creating a representation for each of them. ## CLIPSeg: image segmentation with CLIP\\n[CLIPSeg](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10003) is a model that uses CLIP representations to create image segmentation masks. It was published by Timo Lüddecke and Alexander Ecker. They achieved zero-shot image segmentation by training a Transformer-based decoder on top of the CLIP model, which is kept frozen. The decoder takes in the CLIP representation of an image, and the CLIP representation of the thing you want to segment. Using these two inputs, the CLIPSeg decoder creates a binary segmentation mask. To be more precise, the decoder doesn’t only use the final CLIP representation of the image we want to segment, but it also uses the outputs of some of the layers of CLIP. [Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10003)\\n\\nThe decoder is trained on the [PhraseCut dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01187), which contains over 340,000 phrases with corresponding image segmentation masks.\\n\\nTaken from the [original paper.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10003) \\nThis model was contributed by [nielsr](https://huggingface.co/nielsr). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/timojl/clipseg). ## Usage tips\\n- [`CLIPSegForImageSegmentation`] adds a decoder on top of [`CLIPSegModel`]. The latter is identical to [`CLIPModel`]. - [`CLIPSegForImageSegmentation`] can generate image segmentations based on arbitrary prompts at test time. A prompt can be either a text\\n(provided to the model as `input\\\\_ids`) or an image (provided to the model as `conditional\\\\_pixel\\\\_values`). One can also provide custom\\nconditional embeddings (provided to the model as `conditional\\\\_embeddings`). ## Resources\\nA list of official Hugging Face and community (indicated by 🌎) resources to help you get started with CLIPSeg.

CLIPSeg adds a minimal decoder on top of a frozen [CLIP](clip) model for zero- and one-shot image segmentation.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689ab0393e684812d15f6505', 'page_content': 'Now you see why CLIP was truly a breakthrough in machine learning. The reason why CLIP works so well is that the model was trained on a huge dataset of images with text captions. The dataset contained a whopping 400 million image-text pairs taken from the internet. These images contain a wide variety of objects and concepts, and CLIP is great at creating a representation for each of them. ## CLIPSeg: image segmentation with CLIP\\n[CLIPSeg](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10003) is a model that uses CLIP representations to create image segmentation masks. It was published by Timo Lüddecke and Alexander Ecker. They achieved zero-shot image segmentation by training a Transformer-based decoder on top of the CLIP model, which is kept frozen. The decoder takes in the CLIP representation of an image, and the CLIP representation of the thing you want to segment. Using these two inputs, the CLIPSeg decoder creates a binary segmentation mask. To be more precise, the decoder doesn’t only use the final CLIP representation of the image we want to segment, but it also uses the outputs of some of the layers of CLIP. [Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10003)\\n\\nThe decoder is trained on the [PhraseCut dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01187), which contains over 340,000 phrases with corresponding image segmentation masks.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689abb503e684812d15f71d3', 'page_content': \"Taken from the [original paper.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10003) \\nThis model was contributed by [nielsr](https://huggingface.co/nielsr). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/timojl/clipseg). ## Usage tips\\n- [`CLIPSegForImageSegmentation`] adds a decoder on top of [`CLIPSegModel`]. The latter is identical to [`CLIPModel`]. - [`CLIPSegForImageSegmentation`] can generate image segmentations based on arbitrary prompts at test time. A prompt can be either a text\\n(provided to the model as `input\\\\_ids`) or an image (provided to the model as `conditional\\\\_pixel\\\\_values`). One can also provide custom\\nconditional embeddings (provided to the model as `conditional\\\\_embeddings`). ## Resources\\nA list of official Hugging Face and community (indicated by 🌎) resources to help you get started with CLIPSeg.

Typically, PyTorch model weights are saved or \\\\*pickled\\\\* into a `.bin` file with Python\\'s [`pickle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) utility. However, `pickle` is not secure and pickled files may contain malicious code that can be executed. safetensors is a secure alternative to `pickle`, making it ideal for sharing model weights. This guide will show you how you load `.safetensor` files, and how to convert Stable Diffusion model weights stored in other formats to `.safetensor`. Before you start, make sure you have safetensors installed:\\n```py\\n# uncomment to install the necessary libraries in Colab\\n#!pip install safetensors\\n```\\nIf you look at the [`runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5`](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5/tree/main) repository, you\\'ll see weights inside the `text\\\\_encoder`, `unet` and `vae` subfolders are stored in the `.safetensors` format. By default, 🤗 Diffusers automatically loads these `.safetensors` files from their subfolders if they\\'re available in the model repository. For more explicit control, you can optionally set `use\\\\_safetensors=True` (if `safetensors` is not installed, you\\'ll get an error message asking you to install it):\\n```py\\nfrom diffusers import DiffusionPipeline\\npipeline = DiffusionPipeline.from\\\\_pretrained(\"runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5\", use\\\\_safetensors=True)\\n```\\nHowever, model weights are not necessarily stored in separate subfolders like in the example above. Sometimes, all the weights are stored in a single `.safetensors` file. In this case, if the weights are Stable Diffusion weights, you can load the file directly with the [`~diffusers.loaders.FromSingleFileMixin.from\\\\_single\\\\_file`] method:\\n```py\\nfrom diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline\\npipeline = StableDiffusionPipeline.from\\\\_single\\\\_file(\\n\"https://huggingface.co/WarriorMama777/OrangeMixs/blob/main/Models/AbyssOrangeMix/AbyssOrangeMix.safetensors\"\\n)\\n```\\n## Convert to safetensors\\nNot all weights on the Hub are available in the `.safetensors` format, and you may encounter weights stored as `.bin`.\\n\\nTorch shared tensors\\n## TL;DR\\nUsing specific functions, which should work in most cases for you. This is not without side effects. ```python\\nfrom safetensors.torch import load\\\\_model, save\\\\_model\\nsave\\\\_model(model, \"model.safetensors\")\\n# Instead of save\\\\_file(model.state\\\\_dict(), \"model.safetensors\")\\nload\\\\_model(model, \"model.safetensors\")\\n# Instead of model.load\\\\_state\\\\_dict(load\\\\_file(\"model.safetensors\"))\\n```\\n## What are shared tensors ? Pytorch uses shared tensors for some computation. This is extremely interesting to reduce memory usage in general. One very classic use case is in transformers the `embeddings` are shared with\\n`lm\\\\_head`. By using the same matrix, the model uses less parameters, and gradients\\nflow much better to the `embeddings` (which is the start of the model, so they don\\'t\\nflow easily there, whereas `lm\\\\_head` is at the tail of the model, so gradients are\\nextremely good over there, since they are the same tensors, they both benefit)\\n```python\\nfrom torch import nn\\nclass Model(nn.Module):\\ndef \\\\_\\\\_init\\\\_\\\\_(self):\\nsuper().\\\\_\\\\_init\\\\_\\\\_()\\nself.a = nn.Linear(100, 100)\\nself.b = self.a\\ndef forward(self, x):\\nreturn self.b(self.a(x))\\nmodel = Model()\\nprint(model.state\\\\_dict())\\n# odict\\\\_keys([\\'a.weight\\', \\'a.bias\\', \\'b.weight\\', \\'b.bias\\'])\\ntorch.save(model.state\\\\_dict(), \"model.bin\")\\n# This file is now 41k instead of ~80k, because A and B are the same weight hence only 1 is saved on disk with both `a` and `b` pointing to the same buffer\\n```\\n## Why are shared tensors not saved in `safetensors` ?\\n\\nHowever, many collators also support returning these values as TensorFlow tensors if we specify `return\\\\_tensor=\"tf\"`. This was crucial for our data pipeline to be compatible with TPU training. Thankfully, TensorFlow provides seamless support for reading files from a GCS bucket:\\n```python\\ntraining\\\\_records = tf.io.gfile.glob(os.path.join(args.train\\\\_dataset, \"\\\\*.tfrecord\"))\\n```\\nIf `args.dataset` contains the `gs://` identifier, TensorFlow will understand that it needs to look into a GCS bucket. Loading locally is as easy as removing the `gs://` identifier. For the rest of the data pipeline-related code, you can refer to [this section](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/474bf508dfe0d46fc38585a1bb793e5ba74fddfd/examples/tensorflow/language-modeling-tpu/run\\\\_mlm.py#L186-#L201) in the training script. Once the datasets have been prepared, the model and the optimizer have been initialized, and the model has been compiled, we can do the community’s favorite - `model.fit()`. For training, we didn’t do extensive hyperparameter tuning. We just trained it for longer with a learning rate of 1e-4. We also leveraged the [`PushToHubCallback`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main\\\\_classes/keras\\\\_callbacks#transformers.PushToHubCallback) for model checkpointing and syncing them with the Hub. You can find the hyperparameter details and a trained model here: [https://huggingface.co/tf-tpu/roberta-base-epochs-500-no-wd](https://huggingface.co/tf-tpu/roberta-base-epochs-500-no-wd). Once the model is trained, running inference with it is as easy as:\\n```python\\nfrom transformers import pipeline\\nmodel\\\\_id = \"tf-tpu/roberta-base-epochs-500-no-wd\"\\nunmasker = pipeline(\"fill-mask\", model=model\\\\_id, framework=\"tf\")\\nunmasker(\"Goal of my life is to [MASK].\")\\n[{\\'score\\': 0.1003185287117958,\\n\\'token\\': 52,\\n\\'token\\\\_str\\': \\'be\\',\\n\\'sequence\\': \\'Goal of my life is to be.\\'},\\n{\\'score\\': 0.032648514956235886,\\n\\'token\\': 5,\\n\\'token\\\\_str\\': \\'\\',\\n\\'sequence\\': \\'Goal of my life is to .\\'},\\n{\\'score\\': 0.02152673341333866,\\n\\'token\\': 138,\\n\\'token\\\\_str\\': \\'work\\',\\n\\'sequence\\': \\'Goal of my life is to work.\\'},\\n{\\'score\\': 0.019547373056411743,\\n\\'token\\': 984,\\n\\'token\\\\_str\\': \\'act\\',\\n\\'sequence\\': \\'Goal of my life is to act.\\'},\\n{\\'score\\': 0.01939118467271328,\\n\\'token\\': 73,\\n\\'token\\\\_str\\': \\'have\\',\\n\\'sequence\\': \\'Goal of my life is to have.\\'}]\\n```\\n## Conclusion\\nIf there’s one thing we want to emphasize with this example, it’s that TPU training is \\\\*\\\\*powerful, scalable and easy.\\\\*\\\\* In fact, if you’re already using Transformers models with TF/Keras and streaming data from `tf.data`, you might be shocked at how little work it takes to move your whole training pipeline to TPU.', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': '214b6743-834e-4b61-999e-c10ccfbba3f1', 'tool_call_id': 'call_p3XiNKNMwH2GceZVL8ksILHC', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689ab5fc3e684812d15f6bea', 'page_content': 'Tensorflow API\\n[[autodoc]] safetensors.tensorflow.load\\\\_file\\n[[autodoc]] safetensors.tensorflow.load\\n[[autodoc]] safetensors.tensorflow.save\\\\_file\\n[[autodoc]] safetensors.tensorflow.save', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '6899c21b666af48523f52102', 'page_content': '!--Copyright 2023 The HuggingFace Team.

For more explicit control, you can optionally set `use\\\\_safetensors=True` (if `safetensors` is not installed, you\\'ll get an error message asking you to install it):\\n```py\\nfrom diffusers import DiffusionPipeline\\npipeline = DiffusionPipeline.from\\\\_pretrained(\"runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5\", use\\\\_safetensors=True)\\n```\\nHowever, model weights are not necessarily stored in separate subfolders like in the example above. Sometimes, all the weights are stored in a single `.safetensors` file. In this case, if the weights are Stable Diffusion weights, you can load the file directly with the [`~diffusers.loaders.FromSingleFileMixin.from\\\\_single\\\\_file`] method:\\n```py\\nfrom diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline\\npipeline = StableDiffusionPipeline.from\\\\_single\\\\_file(\\n\"https://huggingface.co/WarriorMama777/OrangeMixs/blob/main/Models/AbyssOrangeMix/AbyssOrangeMix.safetensors\"\\n)\\n```\\n## Convert to safetensors\\nNot all weights on the Hub are available in the `.safetensors` format, and you may encounter weights stored as `.bin`.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689aba063e684812d15f707c', 'page_content': 'Torch shared tensors\\n## TL;DR\\nUsing specific functions, which should work in most cases for you.

Pytorch uses shared tensors for some computation. This is extremely interesting to reduce memory usage in general. One very classic use case is in transformers the `embeddings` are shared with\\n`lm\\\\_head`. By using the same matrix, the model uses less parameters, and gradients\\nflow much better to the `embeddings` (which is the start of the model, so they don\\'t\\nflow easily there, whereas `lm\\\\_head` is at the tail of the model, so gradients are\\nextremely good over there, since they are the same tensors, they both benefit)\\n```python\\nfrom torch import nn\\nclass Model(nn.Module):\\ndef \\\\_\\\\_init\\\\_\\\\_(self):\\nsuper().\\\\_\\\\_init\\\\_\\\\_()\\nself.a = nn.Linear(100, 100)\\nself.b = self.a\\ndef forward(self, x):\\nreturn self.b(self.a(x))\\nmodel = Model()\\nprint(model.state\\\\_dict())\\n# odict\\\\_keys([\\'a.weight\\', \\'a.bias\\', \\'b.weight\\', \\'b.bias\\'])\\ntorch.save(model.state\\\\_dict(), \"model.bin\")\\n# This file is now 41k instead of ~80k, because A and B are the same weight hence only 1 is saved on disk with both `a` and `b` pointing to the same buffer\\n```\\n## Why are shared tensors not saved in `safetensors` ?', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '6899b544af3d2ebb270a028f', 'page_content': 'However, many collators also support returning these values as TensorFlow tensors if we specify `return\\\\_tensor=\"tf\"`. This was crucial for our data pipeline to be compatible with TPU training. Thankfully, TensorFlow provides seamless support for reading files from a GCS bucket:\\n```python\\ntraining\\\\_records = tf.io.gfile.glob(os.path.join(args.train\\\\_dataset, \"\\\\*.tfrecord\"))\\n```\\nIf `args.dataset` contains the `gs://` identifier, TensorFlow will understand that it needs to look into a GCS bucket. Loading locally is as easy as removing the `gs://` identifier. For the rest of the data pipeline-related code, you can refer to [this section](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/474bf508dfe0d46fc38585a1bb793e5ba74fddfd/examples/tensorflow/language-modeling-tpu/run\\\\_mlm.py#L186-#L201) in the training script. Once the datasets have been prepared, the model and the optimizer have been initialized, and the model has been compiled, we can do the community’s favorite - `model.fit()`. For training, we didn’t do extensive hyperparameter tuning. We just trained it for longer with a learning rate of 1e-4. We also leveraged the [`PushToHubCallback`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main\\\\_classes/keras\\\\_callbacks#transformers.PushToHubCallback) for model checkpointing and syncing them with the Hub. You can find the hyperparameter details and a trained model here: [https://huggingface.co/tf-tpu/roberta-base-epochs-500-no-wd](https://huggingface.co/tf-tpu/roberta-base-epochs-500-no-wd). Once the model is trained, running inference with it is as easy as:\\n```python\\nfrom transformers import pipeline\\nmodel\\\\_id = \"tf-tpu/roberta-base-epochs-500-no-wd\"\\nunmasker = pipeline(\"fill-mask\", model=model\\\\_id, framework=\"tf\")\\nunmasker(\"Goal of my life is to [MASK].\")\\n[{\\'score\\': 0.1003185287117958,\\n\\'token\\': 52,\\n\\'token\\\\_str\\': \\'be\\',\\n\\'sequence\\': \\'Goal of my life is to be.\\'},\\n{\\'score\\': 0.032648514956235886,\\n\\'token\\': 5,\\n\\'token\\\\_str\\': \\'\\',\\n\\'sequence\\': \\'Goal of my life is to .\\'},\\n{\\'score\\': 0.02152673341333866,\\n\\'token\\': 138,\\n\\'token\\\\_str\\': \\'work\\',\\n\\'sequence\\': \\'Goal of my life is to work.\\'},\\n{\\'score\\': 0.019547373056411743,\\n\\'token\\': 984,\\n\\'token\\\\_str\\': \\'act\\',\\n\\'sequence\\': \\'Goal of my life is to act.\\'},\\n{\\'score\\': 0.01939118467271328,\\n\\'token\\': 73,\\n\\'token\\\\_str\\': \\'have\\',\\n\\'sequence\\': \\'Goal of my life is to have.\\'}]\\n```\\n## Conclusion\\nIf there’s one thing we want to emphasize with this example, it’s that TPU training is \\\\*\\\\*powerful, scalable and easy.\\\\*\\\\* In fact, if you’re already using Transformers models with TF/Keras and streaming data from `tf.data`, you might be shocked at how little work it takes to move your whole training pipeline to TPU.', 'type': 'Document'}}], 'status': 'success'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'messages', 'AIMessage'], 'kwargs': {'content': 'The TensorFlow API function used to load a saved tensor file is `safetensors.tensorflow.load_file`.', 'response_metadata': {'finish_reason': 'stop', 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_34a54ae93c'}, 'type': 'ai', 'id': 'run--bee6f105-773c-40dd-b2a5-5b640560eba5-0', 'usage_metadata': {'input_tokens': 2155, 'output_tokens': 22, 'total_tokens': 2177, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}, 'tool_calls': [], 'invalid_tool_calls': []}}], 'chat_history': []}\n"

There’s just one problem – you don’t know how to code! 😱 Or maybe you’re a seasoned software engineer who wants to add some ML to your side-project, but you don’t have the time to pick up a whole new tech stack! For many people, the technical barriers to picking up machine learning feel insurmountable. That’s why Hugging Face created [AutoTrain](https://huggingface.co/autotrain), and with the latest feature we’ve just added, we’re making “no-code” machine learning better than ever. Best of all, you can create your first project for ✨ free! ✨\\n[Hugging Face AutoTrain](https://huggingface.co/autotrain) lets you train models with \\\\*\\\\*zero\\\\*\\\\* configuration needed. Just choose your task (translation? how about question answering?), upload your data, and let Hugging Face do the rest of the work! By letting AutoTrain experiment with number of different models, there\\'s even a good chance that you\\'ll end up with a model that performs better than a model that\\'s been hand-trained by an engineer 🤯 We’ve been expanding the number of tasks that we support, and we’re proud to announce that \\\\*\\\\*you can now use AutoTrain for Computer Vision\\\\*\\\\*!\\n\\nState of the art is constantly advancing, and hardly anyone can keep up with its relentless pace. Remember that Google Vision Transformer model I mentioned earlier? Would you like to test it here and now? With Hugging Face, it\\'s [the simplest thing](https://huggingface.co/google/vit-base-patch16-224). `![](assets/31_age_of_ml_as_code/05_vision_transformer.png)`\\nHow about the latest [zero-shot text generation models](https://huggingface.co/bigscience) from the [Big Science project](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/)? `![](assets/31_age_of_ml_as_code/06_big_science.png)`\\nYou can do the same with another [16,000+ models](https://huggingface.co/models) and [1,600+ datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets), with additional tools for [inference](https://huggingface.co/inference-api), [AutoNLP](https://huggingface.co/autonlp), [latency optimization](https://huggingface.co/infinity), and [hardware acceleration](https://huggingface.co/hardware). We can also help you get your project off the ground, [from modeling to production](https://huggingface.co/support). Our mission at Hugging Face is to make Machine Learning as friendly and as productive as possible, for beginners and experts alike. We believe in writing as little code as possible to train, optimize, and deploy models. We believe in built-in best practices. We believe in making infrastructure as transparent as possible. We believe that nothing beats high quality models in production, fast. ### Machine Learning as Code, right here, right now!\\n\\nTo know more about Diffusers and the different use cases, check out the [official documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers). The literature on Diffusion-based models is developing at a rapid pace which is why we partnered with [Jonathan Whitaker](https://github.com/johnowhitaker) to develop a course on it. The course is free, and you can check it out [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusion-models-class). ## Support for third-party libraries\\nCentral to the Hugging Face ecosystem is the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub), which lets people collaborate effectively on Machine Learning. As mentioned earlier, we not only support models from 🤗 Transformers on the Hub but also models from other third-party libraries. To this end, we provide [several utilities](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/models-adding-libraries) so that you can integrate your own library with the Hub. One of the primary advantages of doing this is that it becomes very easy to share artifacts (such as models and datasets) with the community, thereby making it easier for your users to try out your models. When you have your models hosted on the Hub, you can also [add custom inference widgets](https://github.com/huggingface/api-inference-community) for them. Inference widgets allow users to quickly check out the models. This helps with improving user engagement. ![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/cv_state/task_widget_generation.png)\\n\\n## Spaces for computer vision demos\\nWith [Spaces](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-overview), one can easily demonstrate their Machine Learning models. Spaces support direct integrations with [Gradio](https://gradio.app/), [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) empowering practitioners to have a great amount of flexibility while showcasing their models. You can bring in your own Machine Learning framework to build a demo with  Spaces. The Gradio library provides several components for building Computer Vision applications on  Spaces such as [Video](https://gradio.app/docs/#video), [Gallery](https://gradio.app/docs/#gallery), and [Model3D](https://gradio.app/docs/#model3d). The community has been hard at work building some amazing Computer Vision applications that are powered by Spaces:\\n- [Generate 3D voxels from a predicted depth map of an input image](https://huggingface.co/spaces/radames/dpt-depth-estimation-3d-voxels)\\n- [Open vocabulary semantic segmentation](https://huggingface.co/spaces/facebook/ov-seg)\\n- [Narrate videos by generating captions](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nateraw/lavila)\\n- [Classify videos from YouTube](https://huggingface.co/spaces/fcakyon/video-classification)\\n- [Zero-shot video classification](https://huggingface.co/spaces/fcakyon/zero-shot-video-classification)\\n- [Visual question-answering](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nielsr/vilt-vqa)\\n- [Use zero-shot image classification to find best captions for an image to generate similar images](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pharma/CLIP-Interrogator)\\n## 🤗 AutoTrain\\n[AutoTrain](https://huggingface.co/autotrain) provides a “no-code” solution to train state-of-the-art Machine Learning models for tasks like text classification, text summarization, named entity recognition, and more.\\n\\nFor Computer Vision, we currently support [image classification](https://huggingface.co/blog/autotrain-image-classification), but one can expect more task coverage. AutoTrain also enables [automatic model evaluation](https://huggingface.co/spaces/autoevaluate/model-evaluator). This application allows you to evaluate 🤗 Transformers [models](https://huggingface.co/models?library=transformers&sort=downloads) across a wide variety of [datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets) on the Hub. The results of your evaluation will be displayed on the [public leaderboards](https://huggingface.co/spaces/autoevaluate/leaderboards). You can check [this blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/eval-on-the-hub) for more details. ## The technical philosophy\\nIn this section, we wanted to share our philosophy behind adding support for Computer Vision in 🤗 Transformers so that the community is aware of the design choices specific to this area. Even though Transformers started with NLP, we support multiple modalities today, for example – vision, audio, vision-language, and Reinforcement Learning. For all of these modalities, all the corresponding models from Transformers enjoy some common benefits:\\n- Easy model download with a single line of code with `from\\\\_pretrained()`\\n- Easy model upload with `push\\\\_to\\\\_hub()`\\n- Support for loading huge checkpoints with efficient checkpoint sharding techniques\\n- Optimization support (with tools like [Optimum](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum))\\n- Initialization from model configurations\\n- Support for both PyTorch and TensorFlow (non-exhaustive)\\n- and many more\\nUnlike tokenizers, we have preprocessors (such as [this](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model\\\\_doc/vit#transformers.ViTImageProcessor)) that take care of preparing data for the vision models. We have worked hard to ensure the user experience of using a vision model still feels easy and similar:\\n```py\\nfrom transformers import ViTImageProcessor, ViTForImageClassification\\nimport torch\\nfrom datasets import load\\\\_dataset\\ndataset = load\\\\_dataset(\"huggingface/cats-image\")\\nimage = dataset[\"test\"][\"image\"][0]\\nimage\\\\_processor  = ViTImageProcessor.from\\\\_pretrained(\"google/vit-base-patch16-224\")\\nmodel = ViTForImageClassification.from\\\\_pretrained(\"google/vit-base-patch16-224\")\\ninputs = image\\\\_processor(image, return\\\\_tensors=\"pt\")\\nwith torch.no\\\\_grad():\\nlogits = model(\\\\*\\\\*inputs).logits\\n# model predicts one of the 1000 ImageNet classes\\npredicted\\\\_label = logits.argmax(-1).item()\\nprint(model.config.id2label[predicted\\\\_label])\\n# Egyptian cat\\n```\\nEven for a difficult task like object detection, the user experience doesn’t change very much:\\n```py\\nfrom transformers import AutoImageProcessor, AutoModelForObjectDetection\\nfrom PIL import Image\\nimport requests\\nurl = \"http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg\"\\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\\nimage\\\\_processor = AutoImageProcessor.from\\\\_pretrained(\"microsoft/conditional-detr-resnet-50\")\\nmodel = AutoModelForObjectDetection.from\\\\_pretrained(\"microsoft/conditional-detr-resnet-50\")\\ninputs = image\\\\_processor(images=image, return\\\\_tensors=\"pt\")\\noutputs = model(\\\\*\\\\*inputs)\\n# convert outputs (bounding boxes and class logits) to COCO API\\ntarget\\\\_sizes = torch.tensor([image.size[::-1]])\\nresults = image\\\\_processor.post\\\\_process\\\\_object\\\\_detection(\\noutputs, threshold=0.5, target\\\\_sizes=target\\\\_sizes\\n)[0]\\nfor score, label, box in zip(results[\"scores\"], results[\"labels\"], results[\"boxes\"]):\\nbox = [round(i, 2) for i in box.tolist()]\\nprint(\\nf\"Detected {model.config.id2label[label.item()]} with confidence \"\\nf\"{round(score.item(), 3)} at location {box}\"\\n)\\n```\\nLeads to:\\n```bash\\nDetected remote with confidence 0.833 at location [38.31, 72.1, 177.63, 118.45]\\nDetected cat with confidence 0.831 at location [9.2, 51.38, 321.13, 469.0]\\nDetected cat with confidence 0.804 at location [340.3, 16.85, 642.93, 370.95]\\nDetected remote with confidence 0.683 at location [334.48, 73.49, 366.37, 190.01]\\nDetected couch with confidence 0.535 at location [0.52, 1.19, 640.35, 475.1]\\n```\\n## Zero-shot models for vision\\nThere’s been a surge of models that reformulate core vision tasks like segmentation and detection in interesting ways and introduce even more flexibility.', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': '056fbff0-f23b-465e-b141-9d19915a4206', 'tool_call_id': 'call_UnMtC4it92JuxoXqQvoRrqP9', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689ab93f3e684812d15f6f88', 'page_content': \"--\\ntitle: Image Classification with AutoTrain\\nthumbnail: /blog/assets/105\\\\_autotrain-image-classification/thumbnail.png\\nauthors:\\n- user: nimaboscarino\\n---\\n# Image Classification with AutoTrain\\nSo you’ve heard all about the cool things that are happening in the machine learning world, and you want to join in. There’s just one problem – you don’t know how to code! 😱 Or maybe you’re a seasoned software engineer who wants to add some ML to your side-project, but you don’t have the time to pick up a whole new tech stack! For many people, the technical barriers to picking up machine learning feel insurmountable. That’s why Hugging Face created [AutoTrain](https://huggingface.co/autotrain), and with the latest feature we’ve just added, we’re making “no-code” machine learning better than ever. Best of all, you can create your first project for ✨ free! ✨\\n[Hugging Face AutoTrain](https://huggingface.co/autotrain) lets you train models with \\\\*\\\\*zero\\\\*\\\\* configuration needed. Just choose your task (translation? how about question answering?), upload your data, and let Hugging Face do the rest of the work! By letting AutoTrain experiment with number of different models, there's even a good chance that you'll end up with a model that performs better than a model that's been hand-trained by an engineer 🤯 We’ve been expanding the number of tasks that we support, and we’re proud to announce that \\\\*\\\\*you can now use AutoTrain for Computer Vision\\\\*\\\\*!\", 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689aafad3e684812d15f6474', 'page_content': \"State of the art is constantly advancing, and hardly anyone can keep up with its relentless pace.

The course is free, and you can check it out [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusion-models-class). ## Support for third-party libraries\\nCentral to the Hugging Face ecosystem is the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub), which lets people collaborate effectively on Machine Learning. As mentioned earlier, we not only support models from 🤗 Transformers on the Hub but also models from other third-party libraries. To this end, we provide [several utilities](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/models-adding-libraries) so that you can integrate your own library with the Hub. One of the primary advantages of doing this is that it becomes very easy to share artifacts (such as models and datasets) with the community, thereby making it easier for your users to try out your models. When you have your models hosted on the Hub, you can also [add custom inference widgets](https://github.com/huggingface/api-inference-community) for them. Inference widgets allow users to quickly check out the models. This helps with improving user engagement. ![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/cv_state/task_widget_generation.png)\\n\\n## Spaces for computer vision demos\\nWith [Spaces](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-overview), one can easily demonstrate their Machine Learning models. Spaces support direct integrations with [Gradio](https://gradio.app/), [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) empowering practitioners to have a great amount of flexibility while showcasing their models. You can bring in your own Machine Learning framework to build a demo with  Spaces. The Gradio library provides several components for building Computer Vision applications on  Spaces such as [Video](https://gradio.app/docs/#video), [Gallery](https://gradio.app/docs/#gallery), and [Model3D](https://gradio.app/docs/#model3d). The community has been hard at work building some amazing Computer Vision applications that are powered by Spaces:\\n- [Generate 3D voxels from a predicted depth map of an input image](https://huggingface.co/spaces/radames/dpt-depth-estimation-3d-voxels)\\n- [Open vocabulary semantic segmentation](https://huggingface.co/spaces/facebook/ov-seg)\\n- [Narrate videos by generating captions](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nateraw/lavila)\\n- [Classify videos from YouTube](https://huggingface.co/spaces/fcakyon/video-classification)\\n- [Zero-shot video classification](https://huggingface.co/spaces/fcakyon/zero-shot-video-classification)\\n- [Visual question-answering](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nielsr/vilt-vqa)\\n- [Use zero-shot image classification to find best captions for an image to generate similar images](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pharma/CLIP-Interrogator)\\n## 🤗 AutoTrain\\n[AutoTrain](https://huggingface.co/autotrain) provides a “no-code” solution to train state-of-the-art Machine Learning models for tasks like text classification, text summarization, named entity recognition, and more.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '6899bf06666af48523f51d63', 'page_content': 'For Computer Vision, we currently support [image classification](https://huggingface.co/blog/autotrain-image-classification), but one can expect more task coverage.

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a widely used tool in software\\ndevelopment to easily version projects when working collaboratively. This guide will show you how to interact with the\\nrepositories on the Hub, especially:\\n- Create and delete a repository. - Manage branches and tags. - Rename your repository. - Update your repository visibility. - Manage a local copy of your repository. If you are used to working with platforms such as GitLab/GitHub/Bitbucket, your first instinct\\nmight be to use `git` CLI to clone your repo (`git clone`), commit changes (`git add, git commit`) and push them\\n(`git push`). This is valid when using the Hugging Face Hub. However, software engineering and machine learning do\\nnot share the same requirements and workflows. Model repositories might maintain large model weight files for different\\nframeworks and tools, so cloning the repository can lead to you maintaining large local folders with massive sizes. As\\na result, it may be more efficient to use our custom HTTP methods. You can read our [Git vs HTTP paradigm](../concepts/git\\\\_vs\\\\_http)\\nexplanation page for more details. If you want to create and manage a repository on the Hub, your machine must be logged in. If you are not, please refer to\\n[this section](../quick-start#authentication). In the rest of this guide, we will assume that your machine is logged in. ## Repo creation and deletion\\nThe first step is to know how to create and delete repositories. You can only manage repositories that you own (under\\nyour username namespace) or from organizations in which you have write permissions. ### Create a repository\\nCreate an empty repository with [`create\\\\_repo`] and give it a name with the `repo\\\\_id` parameter. The `repo\\\\_id` is your namespace followed by the repository name: `username\\\\_or\\\\_org/repo\\\\_name`. ```py\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import create\\\\_repo\\n>>> create\\\\_repo(\"lysandre/test-model\")\\n\\'https://huggingface.co/lysandre/test-model\\'\\n```\\nBy default, [`create\\\\_repo`] creates a model repository. But you can use the `repo\\\\_type` parameter to specify another repository type. For example, if you want to create a dataset repository:\\n```py\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import create\\\\_repo\\n>>> create\\\\_repo(\"lysandre/test-dataset\", repo\\\\_type=\"dataset\")\\n\\'https://huggingface.co/datasets/lysandre/test-dataset\\'\\n```\\nWhen you create a repository, you can set your repository visibility with the `private` parameter. ```py\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import create\\\\_repo\\n>>> create\\\\_repo(\"lysandre/test-private\", private=True)\\n```\\nIf you want to change the repository visibility at a later time, you can use the [`update\\\\_repo\\\\_visibility`] function.\\n\\nRepositories\\nModels, Spaces, and Datasets are hosted on the Hugging Face Hub as [Git repositories](https://git-scm.com/about), which means that version control and collaboration are core elements of the Hub. In a nutshell, a repository (also known as a \\\\*\\\\*repo\\\\*\\\\*) is a place where code and assets can be stored to back up your work, share it with the community, and work in a team. In these pages, you will go over the basics of getting started with Git and interacting with repositories on the Hub. Once you get the hang of it, you can explore the best practices and next steps that we\\'ve compiled for effective repository usage. ## Contents\\n- [Getting Started with Repositories](./repositories-getting-started)\\n- [Settings](./repositories-settings)\\n- [Pull Requests & Discussions](./repositories-pull-requests-discussions)\\n- [Pull Requests advanced usage](./repositories-pull-requests-discussions#pull-requests-advanced-usage)\\n- [Webhooks](./webhooks)\\n- [Notifications](./notifications)\\n- [Collections](./collections)\\n- [Repository size recommendations](./repositories-recommendations)\\n- [Next Steps](./repositories-next-steps)\\n- [Licenses](./repositories-licenses)\\n\\nHowever, in some cases you might be interested in having\\na local copy of your repository and interact with it using the Git commands you are familiar with. The [`Repository`] class allows you to interact with files and repositories on the Hub with functions similar to Git commands. It is a wrapper over Git and Git-LFS methods to use the Git commands you already know and love. Before starting, please make sure you have Git-LFS installed (see [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for installation instructions). [`Repository`] is deprecated in favor of the http-based alternatives implemented in [`HfApi`]. Given its large adoption in legacy code, the complete removal of [`Repository`] will only happen in release `v1.0`. For more details, please read [this explanation page](./concepts/git\\\\_vs\\\\_http). ### Use a local repository\\nInstantiate a [`Repository`] object with a path to a local repository:\\n```py\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import Repository\\n>>> repo = Repository(local\\\\_dir=\"//\")\\n```\\n### Clone\\nThe `clone\\\\_from` parameter clones a repository from a Hugging Face repository ID to a local directory specified by the `local\\\\_dir` argument:\\n```py\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import Repository\\n>>> repo = Repository(local\\\\_dir=\"w2v2\", clone\\\\_from=\"facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60\")\\n```\\n`clone\\\\_from` can also clone a repository using a URL:\\n```py\\n>>> repo = Repository(local\\\\_dir=\"huggingface-hub\", clone\\\\_from=\"https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60\")\\n```\\nYou can combine the `clone\\\\_from` parameter with [`create\\\\_repo`] to create and clone a repository:\\n```py\\n>>> repo\\\\_url = create\\\\_repo(repo\\\\_id=\"repo\\\\_name\")\\n>>> repo = Repository(local\\\\_dir=\"repo\\\\_local\\\\_path\", clone\\\\_from=repo\\\\_url)\\n```\\nYou can also configure a Git username and email to a cloned repository by specifying the `git\\\\_user` and `git\\\\_email` parameters when you clone a repository.', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': 'd3940291-2655-404d-a08b-1fd38d436eb9', 'tool_call_id': 'call_qAb0orq0kB9FbAtqHrdhtkdq', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '6899b46caf3d2ebb270a01b3', 'page_content': 'Firstly, there are a few methods to manage repository creation, deletion, and others:\\n```python no-format\\nfrom huggingface\\\\_hub import (\\n# User management\\nlogin,\\nlogout,\\nwhoami,\\n# Repository creation and management\\ncreate\\\\_repo,\\ndelete\\\\_repo,\\nupdate\\\\_repo\\\\_visibility,\\n# And some methods to retrieve/change information about the content\\nlist\\\\_models,\\nlist\\\\_datasets,\\nlist\\\\_metrics,\\nlist\\\\_repo\\\\_files,\\nupload\\\\_file,\\ndelete\\\\_file,\\n)\\n```\\nAdditionally, it offers the very powerful `Repository` class to manage a local repository.

This guide will show you how to interact with the\\nrepositories on the Hub, especially:\\n- Create and delete a repository. - Manage branches and tags. - Rename your repository. - Update your repository visibility. - Manage a local copy of your repository. If you are used to working with platforms such as GitLab/GitHub/Bitbucket, your first instinct\\nmight be to use `git` CLI to clone your repo (`git clone`), commit changes (`git add, git commit`) and push them\\n(`git push`). This is valid when using the Hugging Face Hub. However, software engineering and machine learning do\\nnot share the same requirements and workflows. Model repositories might maintain large model weight files for different\\nframeworks and tools, so cloning the repository can lead to you maintaining large local folders with massive sizes. As\\na result, it may be more efficient to use our custom HTTP methods. You can read our [Git vs HTTP paradigm](../concepts/git\\\\_vs\\\\_http)\\nexplanation page for more details. If you want to create and manage a repository on the Hub, your machine must be logged in. If you are not, please refer to\\n[this section](../quick-start#authentication). In the rest of this guide, we will assume that your machine is logged in. ## Repo creation and deletion\\nThe first step is to know how to create and delete repositories. You can only manage repositories that you own (under\\nyour username namespace) or from organizations in which you have write permissions. ### Create a repository\\nCreate an empty repository with [`create\\\\_repo`] and give it a name with the `repo\\\\_id` parameter. The `repo\\\\_id` is your namespace followed by the repository name: `username\\\\_or\\\\_org/repo\\\\_name`. ```py\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import create\\\\_repo\\n>>> create\\\\_repo(\"lysandre/test-model\")\\n\\'https://huggingface.co/lysandre/test-model\\'\\n```\\nBy default, [`create\\\\_repo`] creates a model repository. But you can use the `repo\\\\_type` parameter to specify another repository type. For example, if you want to create a dataset repository:\\n```py\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import create\\\\_repo\\n>>> create\\\\_repo(\"lysandre/test-dataset\", repo\\\\_type=\"dataset\")\\n\\'https://huggingface.co/datasets/lysandre/test-dataset\\'\\n```\\nWhen you create a repository, you can set your repository visibility with the `private` parameter. ```py\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import create\\\\_repo\\n>>> create\\\\_repo(\"lysandre/test-private\", private=True)\\n```\\nIf you want to change the repository visibility at a later time, you can use the [`update\\\\_repo\\\\_visibility`] function.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689ab28c3e684812d15f67b8', 'page_content': \"Repositories\\nModels, Spaces, and Datasets are hosted on the Hugging Face Hub as [Git repositories](https://git-scm.com/about), which means that version control and collaboration are core elements of the Hub. In a nutshell, a repository (also known as a \\\\*\\\\*repo\\\\*\\\\*) is a place where code and assets can be stored to back up your work, share it with the community, and work in a team. In these pages, you will go over the basics of getting started with Git and interacting with repositories on the Hub.

The [`Repository`] class allows you to interact with files and repositories on the Hub with functions similar to Git commands. It is a wrapper over Git and Git-LFS methods to use the Git commands you already know and love. Before starting, please make sure you have Git-LFS installed (see [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for installation instructions). [`Repository`] is deprecated in favor of the http-based alternatives implemented in [`HfApi`]. Given its large adoption in legacy code, the complete removal of [`Repository`] will only happen in release `v1.0`.

In that case the number of rows and bytes can be inferior to the actual numbers.\\n\\n## Offline\\nEven if you don\\'t have an internet connection, it is still possible to load a dataset. As long as you\\'ve downloaded a dataset from the Hub repository before, it should be cached. This means you can reload the dataset from the cache and use it offline. If you know you won\\'t have internet access, you can run 🤗 Datasets in full offline mode. This saves time because instead of waiting for the Dataset builder download to time out, 🤗 Datasets will look directly in the cache. Set the environment variable `HF\\\\_DATASETS\\\\_OFFLINE` to `1` to enable full offline mode. ## Slice splits\\nYou can also choose only to load specific slices of a split. There are two options for slicing a split: using strings or the [`ReadInstruction`] API. Strings are more compact and readable for simple cases, while [`ReadInstruction`] is easier to use with variable slicing parameters. Concatenate a `train` and `test` split by:\\n```py\\n>>> train\\\\_test\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", split=\"train+test\")\\n===STRINGAPI-READINSTRUCTION-SPLIT===\\n>>> ri = datasets.ReadInstruction(\"train\") + datasets.ReadInstruction(\"test\")\\n>>> train\\\\_test\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", split=ri)\\n```\\nSelect specific rows of the `train` split:\\n```py\\n>>> train\\\\_10\\\\_20\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", split=\"train[10:20]\")\\n===STRINGAPI-READINSTRUCTION-SPLIT===\\n>>> train\\\\_10\\\\_20\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpu\", split=datasets.ReadInstruction(\"train\", from\\\\_=10, to=20, unit=\"abs\"))\\n```\\nOr select a percentage of a split with:\\n```py\\n>>> train\\\\_10pct\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", split=\"train[:10%]\")\\n===STRINGAPI-READINSTRUCTION-SPLIT===\\n>>> train\\\\_10\\\\_20\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", split=datasets.ReadInstruction(\"train\", to=10, unit=\"%\"))\\n```\\nSelect a combination of percentages from each split:\\n```py\\n>>> train\\\\_10\\\\_80pct\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", split=\"train[:10%]+train[-80%:]\")\\n===STRINGAPI-READINSTRUCTION-SPLIT===\\n>>> ri = (datasets.ReadInstruction(\"train\", to=10, unit=\"%\") + datasets.ReadInstruction(\"train\", from\\\\_=-80, unit=\"%\"))\\n>>> train\\\\_10\\\\_80pct\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", split=ri)\\n```\\nFinally, you can even create cross-validated splits. The example below creates 10-fold cross-validated splits. Each validation dataset is a 10% chunk, and the training dataset makes up the remaining complementary 90% chunk:\\n```py\\n>>> val\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", split=[f\"train[{k}%:{k+10}%]\" for k in range(0, 100, 10)])\\n>>> train\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", split=[f\"train[:{k}%]+train[{k+10}%:]\" for k in range(0, 100, 10)])\\n===STRINGAPI-READINSTRUCTION-SPLIT===\\n>>> val\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", [datasets.ReadInstruction(\"train\", from\\\\_=k, to=k+10, unit=\"%\") for k in range(0, 100, 10)])\\n>>> train\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", [(datasets.ReadInstruction(\"train\", to=k, unit=\"%\") + datasets.ReadInstruction(\"train\", from\\\\_=k+10, unit=\"%\")) for k in range(0, 100, 10)])\\n```\\n### Percent slicing and rounding\\nThe default behavior is to round the boundaries to the nearest integer for datasets where the requested slice boundaries do not divide evenly by 100. As shown below, some slices may contain more examples than others. For instance, if the following train split includes 999 records, then:\\n```py\\n# 19 records, from 500 (included) to 519 (excluded). >>> train\\\\_50\\\\_52\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", split=\"train[50%:52%]\")\\n# 20 records, from 519 (included) to 539 (excluded). >>> train\\\\_52\\\\_54\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", split=\"train[52%:54%]\")\\n```\\nIf you want equal sized splits, use `pct1\\\\_dropremainder` rounding instead. This treats the specified percentage boundaries as multiples of 1%. ```py\\n# 18 records, from 450 (included) to 468 (excluded). >>> train\\\\_50\\\\_52pct1\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", split=datasets.ReadInstruction(\"train\", from\\\\_=50, to=52, unit=\"%\", rounding=\"pct1\\\\_dropremainder\"))\\n# 18 records, from 468 (included) to 486 (excluded). >>> train\\\\_52\\\\_54pct1\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", split=datasets.ReadInstruction(\"train\",from\\\\_=52, to=54, unit=\"%\", rounding=\"pct1\\\\_dropremainder\"))\\n# Or equivalently:\\n>>> train\\\\_50\\\\_52pct1\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", split=\"train[50%:52%](pct1\\\\_dropremainder)\")\\n>>> train\\\\_52\\\\_54pct1\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", split=\"train[52%:54%](pct1\\\\_dropremainder)\")\\n```\\n`pct1\\\\_dropremainder` rounding may truncate the last examples in a dataset if the number of examples in your dataset don\\'t divide evenly by 100.', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': '3442b0c0-da56-4dd9-a353-9f9717b85dca', 'tool_call_id': 'call_5WPCOE2DQ3YbN0gVtGiR5EEL', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689ab9bc3e684812d15f7024', 'page_content': 'List splits and configurations\\nDatasets typically have splits and may also have configurations.

As long as you\\'ve downloaded a dataset from the Hub repository before, it should be cached. This means you can reload the dataset from the cache and use it offline. If you know you won\\'t have internet access, you can run 🤗 Datasets in full offline mode. This saves time because instead of waiting for the Dataset builder download to time out, 🤗 Datasets will look directly in the cache. Set the environment variable `HF\\\\_DATASETS\\\\_OFFLINE` to `1` to enable full offline mode. ## Slice splits\\nYou can also choose only to load specific slices of a split. There are two options for slicing a split: using strings or the [`ReadInstruction`] API. Strings are more compact and readable for simple cases, while [`ReadInstruction`] is easier to use with variable slicing parameters. Concatenate a `train` and `test` split by:\\n```py\\n>>> train\\\\_test\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", split=\"train+test\")\\n===STRINGAPI-READINSTRUCTION-SPLIT===\\n>>> ri = datasets.ReadInstruction(\"train\") + datasets.ReadInstruction(\"test\")\\n>>> train\\\\_test\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", split=ri)\\n```\\nSelect specific rows of the `train` split:\\n```py\\n>>> train\\\\_10\\\\_20\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", split=\"train[10:20]\")\\n===STRINGAPI-READINSTRUCTION-SPLIT===\\n>>> train\\\\_10\\\\_20\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpu\", split=datasets.ReadInstruction(\"train\", from\\\\_=10, to=20, unit=\"abs\"))\\n```\\nOr select a percentage of a split with:\\n```py\\n>>> train\\\\_10pct\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", split=\"train[:10%]\")\\n===STRINGAPI-READINSTRUCTION-SPLIT===\\n>>> train\\\\_10\\\\_20\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", split=datasets.ReadInstruction(\"train\", to=10, unit=\"%\"))\\n```\\nSelect a combination of percentages from each split:\\n```py\\n>>> train\\\\_10\\\\_80pct\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", split=\"train[:10%]+train[-80%:]\")\\n===STRINGAPI-READINSTRUCTION-SPLIT===\\n>>> ri = (datasets.ReadInstruction(\"train\", to=10, unit=\"%\") + datasets.ReadInstruction(\"train\", from\\\\_=-80, unit=\"%\"))\\n>>> train\\\\_10\\\\_80pct\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", split=ri)\\n```\\nFinally, you can even create cross-validated splits. The example below creates 10-fold cross-validated splits. Each validation dataset is a 10% chunk, and the training dataset makes up the remaining complementary 90% chunk:\\n```py\\n>>> val\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", split=[f\"train[{k}%:{k+10}%]\" for k in range(0, 100, 10)])\\n>>> train\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", split=[f\"train[:{k}%]+train[{k+10}%:]\" for k in range(0, 100, 10)])\\n===STRINGAPI-READINSTRUCTION-SPLIT===\\n>>> val\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", [datasets.ReadInstruction(\"train\", from\\\\_=k, to=k+10, unit=\"%\") for k in range(0, 100, 10)])\\n>>> train\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", [(datasets.ReadInstruction(\"train\", to=k, unit=\"%\") + datasets.ReadInstruction(\"train\", from\\\\_=k+10, unit=\"%\")) for k in range(0, 100, 10)])\\n```\\n### Percent slicing and rounding\\nThe default behavior is to round the boundaries to the nearest integer for datasets where the requested slice boundaries do not divide evenly by 100. As shown below, some slices may contain more examples than others. For instance, if the following train split includes 999 records, then:\\n```py\\n# 19 records, from 500 (included) to 519 (excluded). >>> train\\\\_50\\\\_52\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", split=\"train[50%:52%]\")\\n# 20 records, from 519 (included) to 539 (excluded). >>> train\\\\_52\\\\_54\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", split=\"train[52%:54%]\")\\n```\\nIf you want equal sized splits, use `pct1\\\\_dropremainder` rounding instead. This treats the specified percentage boundaries as multiples of 1%. ```py\\n# 18 records, from 450 (included) to 468 (excluded). >>> train\\\\_50\\\\_52pct1\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", split=datasets.ReadInstruction(\"train\", from\\\\_=50, to=52, unit=\"%\", rounding=\"pct1\\\\_dropremainder\"))\\n# 18 records, from 468 (included) to 486 (excluded). >>> train\\\\_52\\\\_54pct1\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", split=datasets.ReadInstruction(\"train\",from\\\\_=52, to=54, unit=\"%\", rounding=\"pct1\\\\_dropremainder\"))\\n# Or equivalently:\\n>>> train\\\\_50\\\\_52pct1\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", split=\"train[50%:52%](pct1\\\\_dropremainder)\")\\n>>> train\\\\_52\\\\_54pct1\\\\_ds = datasets.load\\\\_dataset(\"bookcorpus\", split=\"train[52%:54%](pct1\\\\_dropremainder)\")\\n```\\n`pct1\\\\_dropremainder` rounding may truncate the last examples in a dataset if the number of examples in your dataset don\\'t divide evenly by 100.', 'type': 'Document'}}], 'status': 'success'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'messages', 'AIMessage'], 'kwargs': {'content': 'The \"duorc\" dataset has six splits.', 'response_metadata': {'finish_reason': 'stop', 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_34a54ae93c'}, 'type': 'ai', 'id': 'run--1bc5603a-1146-473c-bafb-77b26f071dcd-0', 'usage_metadata': {'input_tokens': 3847, 'output_tokens': 10, 'total_tokens': 3857, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}, 'tool_calls': [], 'invalid_tool_calls': []}}], 'chat_history': []}\n"

Unlike [DistributedDataParallel (DDP)](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel.html), FSDP reduces memory-usage because a model is replicated on each GPU. This improves GPU memory-efficiency and allows you to train much larger models on fewer GPUs. FSDP is integrated with the Accelerate, a library for easily managing training in distributed environments, which means it is available for use from the [`Trainer`] class. Before you start, make sure Accelerate is installed and at least PyTorch 2.1.0 or newer. ```bash\\npip install accelerate\\n```\\n## FSDP configuration\\nTo start, run the [`accelerate config`](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/package\\\\_reference/cli#accelerate-config) command to create a configuration file for your training environment. Accelerate uses this configuration file to automatically setup the correct training environment based on your selected training options in `accelerate config`. ```bash\\naccelerate config\\n```\\nWhen you run `accelerate config`, you\\'ll be prompted with a series of options to configure your training environment.\\n\\nBy sharding the model parameters, optimizer and gradient states, and even offloading them to the CPU when they\\'re inactive, FSDP can reduce the high cost of large-scale training. If you\\'re interested in learning more, the following may be helpful:\\n\\\\* Follow along with the more in-depth Accelerate guide for [FSDP](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/usage\\\\_guides/fsdp). \\\\* Read the [Introducing PyTorch Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) API](https://pytorch.org/blog/introducing-pytorch-fully-sharded-data-parallel-api/) blog post. \\\\* Read the [Scaling PyTorch models on Cloud TPUs with FSDP](https://pytorch.org/blog/scaling-pytorch-models-on-cloud-tpus-with-fsdp/) blog post.\\n\\n--\\ntitle: \"Accelerate Large Model Training using PyTorch Fully Sharded Data Parallel\"\\nthumbnail: /blog/assets/62\\\\_pytorch\\\\_fsdp/fsdp-thumbnail.png\\nauthors:\\n- user: smangrul\\n- user: sgugger\\n---\\n# Accelerate Large Model Training using PyTorch Fully Sharded Data Parallel\\nIn this post we will look at how we can leverage \\\\*\\\\*[Accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate)\\\\*\\\\* Library for training large models which enables users to leverage the latest features of \\\\*\\\\*[PyTorch FullyShardedDataParallel (FSDP)](https://pytorch.org/blog/introducing-pytorch-fully-sharded-data-parallel-api/)\\\\*\\\\*. # Motivation 🤗\\n\\\\*\\\\*With the ever increasing scale, size and parameters of the Machine Learning (ML) models, ML practitioners are finding it difficult to train or even load such large models on their hardware.\\\\*\\\\* On one hand, it has been found that large models learn quickly (data and compute efficient) and are significantly more performant when compared to smaller models [1]; on the other hand, it becomes prohibitive to train such models on most of the available hardware.\\n\\n!--⚠️ Note that this file is in Markdown but contain specific syntax for our doc-builder (similar to MDX) that may not be\\nrendered properly in your Markdown viewer. -->\\n# Fully Sharded Data Parallel\\n[Fully sharded data parallel](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/fsdp.html) (FSDP) is developed for distributed training of large pretrained models up to 1T parameters. FSDP achieves this by sharding the model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states across data parallel processes and it can also offload sharded model parameters to a CPU. The memory efficiency afforded by FSDP allows you to scale training to larger batch or model sizes. Currently, FSDP does not confer any reduction in GPU memory usage and FSDP with CPU offload actually consumes 1.65x more GPU memory during training. You can track this PyTorch [issue](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/91165) for any updates. FSDP is supported in 🤗 Accelerate, and you can use it with 🤗 PEFT. This guide will help you learn how to use our FSDP [training script](https://github.com/huggingface/peft/blob/main/examples/conditional\\\\_generation/peft\\\\_lora\\\\_seq2seq\\\\_accelerate\\\\_fsdp.py). You\\'ll configure the script to train a large model for conditional generation. ## Configuration\\nBegin by running the following command to [create a FSDP configuration file](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/main/en/usage\\\\_guides/fsdp) with 🤗 Accelerate. Use the `--config\\\\_file` flag to save the configuration file to a specific location, otherwise it is saved as a `default\\\\_config.yaml` file in the 🤗 Accelerate cache. The configuration file is used to set the default options when you launch the training script. ```bash\\naccelerate config --config\\\\_file fsdp\\\\_config.yaml\\n```\\nYou\\'ll be asked a few questions about your setup, and configure the following arguments. For this example, make sure you fully shard the model parameters, gradients, optimizer states, leverage the CPU for offloading, and wrap model layers based on the Transformer layer class name. ```bash\\n`Sharding Strategy`: [1] FULL\\\\_SHARD (shards optimizer states, gradients and parameters), [2] SHARD\\\\_GRAD\\\\_OP (shards optimizer states and gradients), [3] NO\\\\_SHARD\\n`Offload Params`: Decides Whether to offload parameters and gradients to CPU\\n`Auto Wrap Policy`: [1] TRANSFORMER\\\\_BASED\\\\_WRAP, [2] SIZE\\\\_BASED\\\\_WRAP, [3] NO\\\\_WRAP\\n`Transformer Layer Class to Wrap`: When using `TRANSFORMER\\\\_BASED\\\\_WRAP`, user specifies comma-separated string of transformer layer class names (case-sensitive) to wrap ,e.g,\\n`BertLayer`, `GPTJBlock`, `T5Block`, `BertLayer,BertEmbeddings,BertSelfOutput`... `Min Num Params`: minimum number of parameters when using `SIZE\\\\_BASED\\\\_WRAP`\\n`Backward Prefetch`: [1] BACKWARD\\\\_PRE, [2] BACKWARD\\\\_POST, [3] NO\\\\_PREFETCH\\n`State Dict Type`: [1] FULL\\\\_STATE\\\\_DICT, [2] LOCAL\\\\_STATE\\\\_DICT, [3] SHARDED\\\\_STATE\\\\_DICT\\n```\\nFor example, your FSDP configuration file may look like the following:\\n```yaml\\ncommand\\\\_file: null\\ncommands: null\\ncompute\\\\_environment: LOCAL\\\\_MACHINE\\ndeepspeed\\\\_config: {}\\ndistributed\\\\_type: FSDP\\ndowncast\\\\_bf16: \\'no\\'\\ndynamo\\\\_backend: \\'NO\\'\\nfsdp\\\\_config:\\nfsdp\\\\_auto\\\\_wrap\\\\_policy: TRANSFORMER\\\\_BASED\\\\_WRAP\\nfsdp\\\\_backward\\\\_prefetch\\\\_policy: BACKWARD\\\\_PRE\\nfsdp\\\\_offload\\\\_params: true\\nfsdp\\\\_sharding\\\\_strategy: 1\\nfsdp\\\\_state\\\\_dict\\\\_type: FULL\\\\_STATE\\\\_DICT\\nfsdp\\\\_transformer\\\\_layer\\\\_cls\\\\_to\\\\_wrap: T5Block\\ngpu\\\\_ids: null\\nmachine\\\\_rank: 0\\nmain\\\\_process\\\\_ip: null\\nmain\\\\_process\\\\_port: null\\nmain\\\\_training\\\\_function: main\\nmegatron\\\\_lm\\\\_config: {}\\nmixed\\\\_precision: \\'no\\'\\nnum\\\\_machines: 1\\nnum\\\\_processes: 2\\nrdzv\\\\_backend: static\\nsame\\\\_network: true\\ntpu\\\\_name: null\\ntpu\\\\_zone: null\\nuse\\\\_cpu: false\\n```\\n## The important parts\\nLet\\'s dig a bit deeper into the training script to understand how it works.', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': '0c42f467-b211-49d5-9183-ef5d53176d54', 'tool_call_id': 'call_HMx1hojnTueaGU8HA2Qdd1I7', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689ab6403e684812d15f6c35', 'page_content': '!--Copyright 2023 The HuggingFace Team.

This improves GPU memory-efficiency and allows you to train much larger models on fewer GPUs. FSDP is integrated with the Accelerate, a library for easily managing training in distributed environments, which means it is available for use from the [`Trainer`] class. Before you start, make sure Accelerate is installed and at least PyTorch 2.1.0 or newer. ```bash\\npip install accelerate\\n```\\n## FSDP configuration\\nTo start, run the [`accelerate config`](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/package\\\\_reference/cli#accelerate-config) command to create a configuration file for your training environment. Accelerate uses this configuration file to automatically setup the correct training environment based on your selected training options in `accelerate config`. ```bash\\naccelerate config\\n```\\nWhen you run `accelerate config`, you\\'ll be prompted with a series of options to configure your training environment.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689ab6403e684812d15f6c38', 'page_content': \"By sharding the model parameters, optimizer and gradient states, and even offloading them to the CPU when they're inactive, FSDP can reduce the high cost of large-scale training.

FSDP achieves this by sharding the model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states across data parallel processes and it can also offload sharded model parameters to a CPU. The memory efficiency afforded by FSDP allows you to scale training to larger batch or model sizes. Currently, FSDP does not confer any reduction in GPU memory usage and FSDP with CPU offload actually consumes 1.65x more GPU memory during training. You can track this PyTorch [issue](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/91165) for any updates. FSDP is supported in 🤗 Accelerate, and you can use it with 🤗 PEFT. This guide will help you learn how to use our FSDP [training script](https://github.com/huggingface/peft/blob/main/examples/conditional\\\\_generation/peft\\\\_lora\\\\_seq2seq\\\\_accelerate\\\\_fsdp.py). You'll configure the script to train a large model for conditional generation. ## Configuration\\nBegin by running the following command to [create a FSDP configuration file](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/main/en/usage\\\\_guides/fsdp) with 🤗 Accelerate. Use the `--config\\\\_file` flag to save the configuration file to a specific location, otherwise it is saved as a `default\\\\_config.yaml` file in the 🤗 Accelerate cache. The configuration file is used to set the default options when you launch the training script. ```bash\\naccelerate config --config\\\\_file fsdp\\\\_config.yaml\\n```\\nYou'll be asked a few questions about your setup, and configure the following arguments. For this example, make sure you fully shard the model parameters, gradients, optimizer states, leverage the CPU for offloading, and wrap model layers based on the Transformer layer class name. ```bash\\n`Sharding Strategy`: [1] FULL\\\\_SHARD (shards optimizer states, gradients and parameters), [2] SHARD\\\\_GRAD\\\\_OP (shards optimizer states and gradients), [3] NO\\\\_SHARD\\n`Offload Params`: Decides Whether to offload parameters and gradients to CPU\\n`Auto Wrap Policy`: [1] TRANSFORMER\\\\_BASED\\\\_WRAP, [2] SIZE\\\\_BASED\\\\_WRAP, [3] NO\\\\_WRAP\\n`Transformer Layer Class to Wrap`: When using `TRANSFORMER\\\\_BASED\\\\_WRAP`, user specifies comma-separated string of transformer layer class names (case-sensitive) to wrap ,e.g,\\n`BertLayer`, `GPTJBlock`, `T5Block`, `BertLayer,BertEmbeddings,BertSelfOutput`... `Min Num Params`: minimum number of parameters when using `SIZE\\\\_BASED\\\\_WRAP`\\n`Backward Prefetch`: [1] BACKWARD\\\\_PRE, [2] BACKWARD\\\\_POST, [3] NO\\\\_PREFETCH\\n`State Dict Type`: [1] FULL\\\\_STATE\\\\_DICT, [2] LOCAL\\\\_STATE\\\\_DICT, [3] SHARDED\\\\_STATE\\\\_DICT\\n```\\nFor example, your FSDP configuration file may look like the following:\\n```yaml\\ncommand\\\\_file: null\\ncommands: null\\ncompute\\\\_environment: LOCAL\\\\_MACHINE\\ndeepspeed\\\\_config: {}\\ndistributed\\\\_type: FSDP\\ndowncast\\\\_bf16: 'no'\\ndynamo\\\\_backend: 'NO'\\nfsdp\\\\_config:\\nfsdp\\\\_auto\\\\_wrap\\\\_policy: TRANSFORMER\\\\_BASED\\\\_WRAP\\nfsdp\\\\_backward\\\\_prefetch\\\\_policy: BACKWARD\\\\_PRE\\nfsdp\\\\_offload\\\\_params: true\\nfsdp\\\\_sharding\\\\_strategy: 1\\nfsdp\\\\_state\\\\_dict\\\\_type: FULL\\\\_STATE\\\\_DICT\\nfsdp\\\\_transformer\\\\_layer\\\\_cls\\\\_to\\\\_wrap: T5Block\\ngpu\\\\_ids: null\\nmachine\\\\_rank: 0\\nmain\\\\_process\\\\_ip: null\\nmain\\\\_process\\\\_port: null\\nmain\\\\_training\\\\_function: main\\nmegatron\\\\_lm\\\\_config: {}\\nmixed\\\\_precision: 'no'\\nnum\\\\_machines: 1\\nnum\\\\_processes: 2\\nrdzv\\\\_backend: static\\nsame\\\\_network: true\\ntpu\\\\_name: null\\ntpu\\\\_zone: null\\nuse\\\\_cpu: false\\n```\\n## The important parts\\nLet's dig a bit deeper into the training script to understand how it works.\", 'type': 'Document'}}], 'status': 'success'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'messages', 'AIMessage'], 'kwargs': {'content': \"Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) is a data parallel method designed for distributed training of large pretrained models, allowing for efficient sharding of a model's parameters, gradients, and optimizer states across multiple GPUs.

Typically, PyTorch model weights are saved or \\\\*pickled\\\\* into a `.bin` file with Python\\'s [`pickle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) utility. However, `pickle` is not secure and pickled files may contain malicious code that can be executed. safetensors is a secure alternative to `pickle`, making it ideal for sharing model weights. This guide will show you how you load `.safetensor` files, and how to convert Stable Diffusion model weights stored in other formats to `.safetensor`. Before you start, make sure you have safetensors installed:\\n```py\\n# uncomment to install the necessary libraries in Colab\\n#!pip install safetensors\\n```\\nIf you look at the [`runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5`](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5/tree/main) repository, you\\'ll see weights inside the `text\\\\_encoder`, `unet` and `vae` subfolders are stored in the `.safetensors` format. By default, 🤗 Diffusers automatically loads these `.safetensors` files from their subfolders if they\\'re available in the model repository. For more explicit control, you can optionally set `use\\\\_safetensors=True` (if `safetensors` is not installed, you\\'ll get an error message asking you to install it):\\n```py\\nfrom diffusers import DiffusionPipeline\\npipeline = DiffusionPipeline.from\\\\_pretrained(\"runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5\", use\\\\_safetensors=True)\\n```\\nHowever, model weights are not necessarily stored in separate subfolders like in the example above. Sometimes, all the weights are stored in a single `.safetensors` file. In this case, if the weights are Stable Diffusion weights, you can load the file directly with the [`~diffusers.loaders.FromSingleFileMixin.from\\\\_single\\\\_file`] method:\\n```py\\nfrom diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline\\npipeline = StableDiffusionPipeline.from\\\\_single\\\\_file(\\n\"https://huggingface.co/WarriorMama777/OrangeMixs/blob/main/Models/AbyssOrangeMix/AbyssOrangeMix.safetensors\"\\n)\\n```\\n## Convert to safetensors\\nNot all weights on the Hub are available in the `.safetensors` format, and you may encounter weights stored as `.bin`.\\n\\nIn PyTorch, the\\nname of a layer is defined by the name of the class attribute you give the layer. Let\\'s define a dummy model in\\nPyTorch, called `SimpleModel` as follows:\\n```python\\nfrom torch import nn\\nclass SimpleModel(nn.Module):\\ndef \\\\_\\\\_init\\\\_\\\\_(self):\\nsuper().\\\\_\\\\_init\\\\_\\\\_()\\nself.dense = nn.Linear(10, 10)\\nself.intermediate = nn.Linear(10, 10)\\nself.layer\\\\_norm = nn.LayerNorm(10)\\n```\\nNow we can create an instance of this model definition which will fill all weights: `dense`, `intermediate`,\\n`layer\\\\_norm` with random weights. We can print the model to see its architecture\\n```python\\nmodel = SimpleModel()\\nprint(model)\\n```\\nThis will print out the following:\\n```\\nSimpleModel(\\n(dense): Linear(in\\\\_features=10, out\\\\_features=10, bias=True)\\n(intermediate): Linear(in\\\\_features=10, out\\\\_features=10, bias=True)\\n(layer\\\\_norm): LayerNorm((10,), eps=1e-05, elementwise\\\\_affine=True)\\n)\\n```\\nWe can see that the layer names are defined by the name of the class attribute in PyTorch.

An incorrect shape is most likely due to an incorrect setting of the config parameters in `BrandNewBertConfig()` that\\ndo not exactly match those that were used for the checkpoint you want to convert.\\n\\nI\\'ve taken care to make sure any third party code included or adapted has compatible (permissive) licenses such as MIT, BSD, etc. I\\'ve made an effort to avoid any GPL / LGPL conflicts. That said, it is your responsibility to ensure you comply with licenses here and conditions of any dependent licenses. Where applicable, I\\'ve linked the sources/references for various components in docstrings. If you think I\\'ve missed anything please create an issue. ### Pretrained Weights\\nSo far all of the pretrained weights available here are pretrained on ImageNet with a select few that have some additional pretraining (see extra note below). ImageNet was released for non-commercial research purposes only (https://image-net.org/download). It\\'s not clear what the implications of that are for the use of pretrained weights from that dataset. Any models I have trained with ImageNet are done for research purposes and one should assume that the original dataset license applies to the weights. It\\'s best to seek legal advice if you intend to use the pretrained weights in a commercial product. #### Pretrained on more than ImageNet\\nSeveral weights included or references here were pretrained with proprietary datasets that I do not have access to. These include the Facebook WSL, SSL, SWSL ResNe(Xt) and the Google Noisy Student EfficientNet models. The Facebook models have an explicit non-commercial license (CC-BY-NC 4.0, https://github.com/facebookresearch/semi-supervised-ImageNet1K-models, https://github.com/facebookresearch/WSL-Images). The Google models do not appear to have any restriction beyond the Apache 2.0 license (and ImageNet concerns). In either case, you should contact Facebook or Google with any questions. ## Citing\\n### BibTeX\\n```bibtex\\n@misc{rw2019timm,\\nauthor = {Ross Wightman},\\ntitle = {PyTorch Image Models},\\nyear = {2019},\\npublisher = {GitHub},\\njournal = {GitHub repository},\\ndoi = {10.5281/zenodo.4414861},\\nhowpublished = {\\\\url{https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models}}\\n}\\n```\\n### Latest DOI\\n[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/168799526.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/168799526)', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': '164c6ca7-6e59-4b41-8112-eb1604492bd4', 'tool_call_id': 'call_bU6Utbc6GD4QnxHbhwiMdmFf', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '6899c0ba666af48523f51f40', 'page_content': \"Convert weights to safetensors\\nPyTorch model weights are commonly saved and stored as `.bin` files with Python's [`pickle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) utility.

If you think I've missed anything please create an issue. ### Pretrained Weights\\nSo far all of the pretrained weights available here are pretrained on ImageNet with a select few that have some additional pretraining (see extra note below). ImageNet was released for non-commercial research purposes only (https://image-net.org/download). It's not clear what the implications of that are for the use of pretrained weights from that dataset. Any models I have trained with ImageNet are done for research purposes and one should assume that the original dataset license applies to the weights. It's best to seek legal advice if you intend to use the pretrained weights in a commercial product. #### Pretrained on more than ImageNet\\nSeveral weights included or references here were pretrained with proprietary datasets that I do not have access to. These include the Facebook WSL, SSL, SWSL ResNe(Xt) and the Google Noisy Student EfficientNet models. The Facebook models have an explicit non-commercial license (CC-BY-NC 4.0, https://github.com/facebookresearch/semi-supervised-ImageNet1K-models, https://github.com/facebookresearch/WSL-Images). The Google models do not appear to have any restriction beyond the Apache 2.0 license (and ImageNet concerns). In either case, you should contact Facebook or Google with any questions. ## Citing\\n### BibTeX\\n```bibtex\\n@misc{rw2019timm,\\nauthor = {Ross Wightman},\\ntitle = {PyTorch Image Models},\\nyear = {2019},\\npublisher = {GitHub},\\njournal = {GitHub repository},\\ndoi = {10.5281/zenodo.4414861},\\nhowpublished = {\\\\url{https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models}}\\n}\\n```\\n### Latest DOI\\n[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/168799526.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/168799526)\", 'type': 'Document'}}], 'status': 'success'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'messages', 'AIMessage'], 'kwargs': {'content': 'The more secure file format used to save and store PyTorch model weights is `.safetensors`.', 'response_metadata': {'finish_reason': 'stop', 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_34a54ae93c'}, 'type': 'ai', 'id': 'run--75f1bb1a-df83-46dc-93ca-c292741238e7-0', 'usage_metadata': {'input_tokens': 2948, 'output_tokens': 20, 'total_tokens': 2968, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}, 'tool_calls': [], 'invalid_tool_calls': []}}], 'chat_history': []}\n"

The retriever and seq2seq modules are initialized from pretrained models, and fine-tuned jointly, allowing\\nboth retrieval and generation to adapt to downstream tasks. It is based on the paper [Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401) by Patrick Lewis, Ethan Perez, Aleksandara Piktus, Fabio Petroni, Vladimir\\nKarpukhin, Naman Goyal, Heinrich Küttler, Mike Lewis, Wen-tau Yih, Tim Rocktäschel, Sebastian Riedel, Douwe Kiela. The abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*Large pre-trained language models have been shown to store factual knowledge in their parameters, and achieve\\nstate-of-the-art results when fine-tuned on downstream NLP tasks. However, their ability to access and precisely\\nmanipulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind\\ntask-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge\\nremain open research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit nonparametric\\nmemory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a\\ngeneral-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) — models which combine pre-trained\\nparametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a\\npre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a\\npre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages\\nacross the whole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our\\nmodels on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain QA tasks,\\noutperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation\\ntasks, we find that RAG models generate more specific, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art\\nparametric-only seq2seq baseline.\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [ola13](https://huggingface.co/ola13). ## Usage tips\\nRetrieval-augmented generation (\"RAG\") models combine the powers of pretrained dense retrieval (DPR) and Seq2Seq models.

These contextual documents are used in conjunction with the original input to produce an output. The GIF is taken from [Facebook\\'s original blog post](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-streamlining-the-creation-of-intelligent-natural-language-processing-models).\\\\_\\nRecently, [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) partnered with [Facebook AI](https://ai.facebook.com/) to introduce the [RAG](https://twitter.com/huggingface/status/1310597560906780680) model as part of its Transformers library. [RAG](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-streamlining-the-creation-of-intelligent-natural-language-processing-models/) acts just like any other [seq2seq model](https://blog.keras.io/a-ten-minute-introduction-to-sequence-to-sequence-learning-in-keras.html). However, [RAG](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-streamlining-the-creation-of-intelligent-natural-language-processing-models/) has an intermediate component that retrieves contextual documents from an external knowledge base (like a Wikipedia text corpus). These documents are then used in conjunction with the input sequence and passed into the underlying seq2seq [generator](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate).\\n\\nIntro\\nAuthors: @patrickvonplaten and @lhoestq\\nAimed at tackling the knowledge-intensive NLP tasks (think tasks a human wouldn\\'t be expected to solve without access to external knowledge sources), RAG models are seq2seq models with access to a retrieval mechanism providing relevant context documents at training and evaluation time. A RAG model encapsulates two core components: a question encoder and a generator. During a forward pass, we encode the input with the question encoder and pass it\\nto the retriever to extract relevant context documents. The documents are then prepended to the input.

The abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*Large pre-trained language models have been shown to store factual knowledge in their parameters, and achieve\\nstate-of-the-art results when fine-tuned on downstream NLP tasks.

Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge\\nremain open research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit nonparametric\\nmemory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a\\ngeneral-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) — models which combine pre-trained\\nparametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a\\npre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a\\npre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages\\nacross the whole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our\\nmodels on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain QA tasks,\\noutperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation\\ntasks, we find that RAG models generate more specific, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art\\nparametric-only seq2seq baseline.\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [ola13](https://huggingface.co/ola13). ## Usage tips\\nRetrieval-augmented generation (\"RAG\") models combine the powers of pretrained dense retrieval (DPR) and Seq2Seq models.

MarkupLM is BERT, but\\napplied to HTML pages instead of raw text documents. The model incorporates additional embedding layers to improve\\nperformance, similar to [LayoutLM](layoutlm). The model can be used for tasks like question answering on web pages or information extraction from web pages. It obtains\\nstate-of-the-art results on 2 important benchmarks:\\n- [WebSRC](https://x-lance.github.io/WebSRC/), a dataset for Web-Based Structural Reading Comprehension (a bit like SQuAD but for web pages)\\n- [SWDE](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221299838\\\\_From\\\\_one\\\\_tree\\\\_to\\\\_a\\\\_forest\\\\_a\\\\_unified\\\\_solution\\\\_for\\\\_structured\\\\_web\\\\_data\\\\_extraction), a dataset\\nfor information extraction from web pages (basically named-entity recogntion on web pages)\\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*Multimodal pre-training with text, layout, and image has made significant progress for Visually-rich Document\\nUnderstanding (VrDU), especially the fixed-layout documents such as scanned document images. While, there are still a\\nlarge number of digital documents where the layout information is not fixed and needs to be interactively and\\ndynamically rendered for visualization, making existing layout-based pre-training approaches not easy to apply. In this\\npaper, we propose MarkupLM for document understanding tasks with markup languages as the backbone such as\\nHTML/XML-based documents, where text and markup information is jointly pre-trained. Experiment results show that the\\npre-trained MarkupLM significantly outperforms the existing strong baseline models on several document understanding\\ntasks. The pre-trained model and code will be publicly available.\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [nielsr](https://huggingface.co/nielsr). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/markuplm). ## Usage tips\\n- In addition to `input\\\\_ids`, [`~MarkupLMModel.forward`] expects 2 additional inputs, namely `xpath\\\\_tags\\\\_seq` and `xpath\\\\_subs\\\\_seq`. These are the XPATH tags and subscripts respectively for each token in the input sequence. - One can use [`MarkupLMProcessor`] to prepare all data for the model. Refer to the [usage guide](#usage-markuplmprocessor) for more info. ![drawing](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/model_doc/markuplm_architecture.jpg)\\n MarkupLM architecture. Taken from the [original paper.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08518) \\n## Usage: MarkupLMProcessor\\nThe easiest way to prepare data for the model is to use [`MarkupLMProcessor`], which internally combines a feature extractor\\n([`MarkupLMFeatureExtractor`]) and a tokenizer ([`MarkupLMTokenizer`] or [`MarkupLMTokenizerFast`]). The feature extractor is\\nused to extract all nodes and xpaths from the HTML strings, which are then provided to the tokenizer, which turns them into the\\ntoken-level inputs of the model (`input\\\\_ids` etc.). Note that you can still use the feature extractor and tokenizer separately,\\nif you only want to handle one of the two tasks. ```python\\nfrom transformers import MarkupLMFeatureExtractor, MarkupLMTokenizerFast, MarkupLMProcessor\\nfeature\\\\_extractor = MarkupLMFeatureExtractor()\\ntokenizer = MarkupLMTokenizerFast.from\\\\_pretrained(\"microsoft/markuplm-base\")\\nprocessor = MarkupLMProcessor(feature\\\\_extractor, tokenizer)\\n```\\nIn short, one can provide HTML strings (and possibly additional data) to [`MarkupLMProcessor`],\\nand it will create the inputs expected by the model. Internally, the processor first uses\\n[`MarkupLMFeatureExtractor`] to get a list of nodes and corresponding xpaths. The nodes and\\nxpaths are then provided to [`MarkupLMTokenizer`] or [`MarkupLMTokenizerFast`], which converts them\\nto token-level `input\\\\_ids`, `attention\\\\_mask`, `token\\\\_type\\\\_ids`, `xpath\\\\_subs\\\\_seq`, `xpath\\\\_tags\\\\_seq`. Optionally, one can provide node labels to the processor, which are turned into token-level `labels`. [`MarkupLMFeatureExtractor`] uses [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/), a Python library for\\npulling data out of HTML and XML files, under the hood. Note that you can still use your own parsing solution of\\nchoice, and provide the nodes and xpaths yourself to [`MarkupLMTokenizer`] or [`MarkupLMTokenizerFast`].\\n\\n!--Copyright 2021 The HuggingFace Team.

It obtains\\nstate-of-the-art results on 2 important benchmarks:\\n- [WebSRC](https://x-lance.github.io/WebSRC/), a dataset for Web-Based Structural Reading Comprehension (a bit like SQuAD but for web pages)\\n- [SWDE](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221299838\\\\_From\\\\_one\\\\_tree\\\\_to\\\\_a\\\\_forest\\\\_a\\\\_unified\\\\_solution\\\\_for\\\\_structured\\\\_web\\\\_data\\\\_extraction), a dataset\\nfor information extraction from web pages (basically named-entity recogntion on web pages)\\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*Multimodal pre-training with text, layout, and image has made significant progress for Visually-rich Document\\nUnderstanding (VrDU), especially the fixed-layout documents such as scanned document images. While, there are still a\\nlarge number of digital documents where the layout information is not fixed and needs to be interactively and\\ndynamically rendered for visualization, making existing layout-based pre-training approaches not easy to apply. In this\\npaper, we propose MarkupLM for document understanding tasks with markup languages as the backbone such as\\nHTML/XML-based documents, where text and markup information is jointly pre-trained. Experiment results show that the\\npre-trained MarkupLM significantly outperforms the existing strong baseline models on several document understanding\\ntasks. The pre-trained model and code will be publicly available.\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [nielsr](https://huggingface.co/nielsr). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/markuplm). ## Usage tips\\n- In addition to `input\\\\_ids`, [`~MarkupLMModel.forward`] expects 2 additional inputs, namely `xpath\\\\_tags\\\\_seq` and `xpath\\\\_subs\\\\_seq`. These are the XPATH tags and subscripts respectively for each token in the input sequence. - One can use [`MarkupLMProcessor`] to prepare all data for the model. Refer to the [usage guide](#usage-markuplmprocessor) for more info. ![drawing](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/model_doc/markuplm_architecture.jpg)\\n MarkupLM architecture. Taken from the [original paper.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08518) \\n## Usage: MarkupLMProcessor\\nThe easiest way to prepare data for the model is to use [`MarkupLMProcessor`], which internally combines a feature extractor\\n([`MarkupLMFeatureExtractor`]) and a tokenizer ([`MarkupLMTokenizer`] or [`MarkupLMTokenizerFast`]). The feature extractor is\\nused to extract all nodes and xpaths from the HTML strings, which are then provided to the tokenizer, which turns them into the\\ntoken-level inputs of the model (`input\\\\_ids` etc.). Note that you can still use the feature extractor and tokenizer separately,\\nif you only want to handle one of the two tasks. ```python\\nfrom transformers import MarkupLMFeatureExtractor, MarkupLMTokenizerFast, MarkupLMProcessor\\nfeature\\\\_extractor = MarkupLMFeatureExtractor()\\ntokenizer = MarkupLMTokenizerFast.from\\\\_pretrained(\"microsoft/markuplm-base\")\\nprocessor = MarkupLMProcessor(feature\\\\_extractor, tokenizer)\\n```\\nIn short, one can provide HTML strings (and possibly additional data) to [`MarkupLMProcessor`],\\nand it will create the inputs expected by the model. Internally, the processor first uses\\n[`MarkupLMFeatureExtractor`] to get a list of nodes and corresponding xpaths. The nodes and\\nxpaths are then provided to [`MarkupLMTokenizer`] or [`MarkupLMTokenizerFast`], which converts them\\nto token-level `input\\\\_ids`, `attention\\\\_mask`, `token\\\\_type\\\\_ids`, `xpath\\\\_subs\\\\_seq`, `xpath\\\\_tags\\\\_seq`. Optionally, one can provide node labels to the processor, which are turned into token-level `labels`. [`MarkupLMFeatureExtractor`] uses [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/), a Python library for\\npulling data out of HTML and XML files, under the hood. Note that you can still use your own parsing solution of\\nchoice, and provide the nodes and xpaths yourself to [`MarkupLMTokenizer`] or [`MarkupLMTokenizerFast`].', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689aa5773e684812d15f5870', 'page_content': '!--Copyright 2021 The HuggingFace Team.

An example of a popular encoder-only architecture is BERT, which is the most popular model of its kind. Let\\'s first start by understanding how it works. We\\'ll use a small example, using three words. We use these as inputs, and pass them through the encoder. We retrieve a numerical representation of each word. Here, for example, the encoder converts the three words “Welcome to NYC” in these three sequences of numbers. The encoder outputs exactly one sequence of numbers per input word. This numerical representation can also be called a \"Feature vector\", or \"Feature tensor\". Let\\'s dive in this representation. It contains one vector per word that was passed through the encoder. Each of these vector is a numerical representation of the word in question. The dimension of that vector is defined by the architecture of the model, for the base BERT model, it is 768. These representations contain the value of a word; but contextualized. For example, the vector attributed to the word \"to\", isn\\'t the representation of only the \"to\" word. It also takes into account the words around it, which we call the “context”.As in, it looks to the left context, the word on the left of the one we\\'re studying (here the word \"Welcome\") and the context on the right (here the word \"NYC\") and outputs a value for the word, within its context. It is therefore a contextualized value. One could say that the vector of 768 values holds the \"meaning\" of that word in the text. How it does this is thanks to the self-attention mechanism. The self-attention mechanism relates to different positions (or different words) in a single sequence, in order to compute a representation of that sequence.\\n\\nThe original code can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/bert). ## Usage tips\\n- BERT is a model with absolute position embeddings so it\\'s usually advised to pad the inputs on the right rather than\\nthe left. - BERT was trained with the masked language modeling (MLM) and next sentence prediction (NSP) objectives. It is\\nefficient at predicting masked tokens and at NLU in general, but is not optimal for text generation. - Corrupts the inputs by using random masking, more precisely, during pretraining, a given percentage of tokens (usually 15%) is masked by:\\n\\\\* a special mask token with probability 0.8\\n\\\\* a random token different from the one masked with probability 0.1\\n\\\\* the same token with probability 0.1\\n- The model must predict the original sentence, but has a second objective: inputs are two sentences A and B (with a separation token in between). With probability 50%, the sentences are consecutive in the corpus, in the remaining 50% they are not related. The model has to predict if the sentences are consecutive or not. ## Resources\\nA list of official Hugging Face and community (indicated by 🌎) resources to help you get started with BERT.', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': 'e440194a-0645-4ec0-85f5-63295e028187', 'tool_call_id': 'call_eoiGxLRD175z18Gkrtqo1iOs', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689abb613e684812d15f71e1', 'page_content': '!--Copyright 2020 The HuggingFace Team.

It also takes into account the words around it, which we call the “context”.As in, it looks to the left context, the word on the left of the one we\\'re studying (here the word \"Welcome\") and the context on the right (here the word \"NYC\") and outputs a value for the word, within its context. It is therefore a contextualized value. One could say that the vector of 768 values holds the \"meaning\" of that word in the text. How it does this is thanks to the self-attention mechanism. The self-attention mechanism relates to different positions (or different words) in a single sequence, in order to compute a representation of that sequence.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689abb613e684812d15f71e2', 'page_content': \"The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/bert). ## Usage tips\\n- BERT is a model with absolute position embeddings so it's usually advised to pad the inputs on the right rather than\\nthe left. - BERT was trained with the masked language modeling (MLM) and next sentence prediction (NSP) objectives. It is\\nefficient at predicting masked tokens and at NLU in general, but is not optimal for text generation. - Corrupts the inputs by using random masking, more precisely, during pretraining, a given percentage of tokens (usually 15%) is masked by:\\n\\\\* a special mask token with probability 0.8\\n\\\\* a random token different from the one masked with probability 0.1\\n\\\\* the same token with probability 0.1\\n- The model must predict the original sentence, but has a second objective: inputs are two sentences A and B (with a separation token in between). With probability 50%, the sentences are consecutive in the corpus, in the remaining 50% they are not related.

There are a lot of different algorithms that can be used for subword tokenization, and most models obtaining state-of-the-art results in English today use some kind of subword-tokenization algorithm.\\n\\net\\'s see together what is the training strategy of the WordPiece algorithm and how it performs the tokenization of a text once trained WordPiece is a tokenization algorithm introduced by Google. It is used for example by Bert. To our knowledge, the code of Word Pieces has not been open sourced, so we base our explanations on our own interpretation of the published literature. What is the training strategy of WordPiece? Similarly to the BPE algorithm, WordPiece starts by establishing an initial vocabulary composed of elementary units and then increases this vocabulary to the desired size. To build the initial vocabulary, we divide each word in the training corpus into the sequence of letters that make it up. As you can see, there is a small subtlety: we add a 2 hashtags in front of the letters that do not start a word. By keeping only one occurrence per elementary unit we now have our initial vocabulary. We will list all the existing pairs in our corpus. Once we have this list, we will calculate a score for each of these pairs. As for the BPE algorithm, we will select the pair with the highest score. Taking for example the first pair composed of H and U. The score of a pair is simply equal to the frequency of appearance of the pair divided by the product of the frequency of appearance of the first token by the frequency of appearance of the second token. Thus at a fixed frequency of appearance of the pair, if the subparts of the pair are very frequent in the corpus then this score will be decreased. In our example, the pair \"hu\" appears 4 times, the letter \"h\" 4 times and the letter u 4 times.\\n\\nWordPiece tokenization[[wordpiece-tokenization]]\\nWordPiece is the tokenization algorithm Google developed to pretrain BERT. It has since been reused in quite a few Transformer models based on BERT, such as DistilBERT, MobileBERT, Funnel Transformers, and MPNET. It\\'s very similar to BPE in terms of the training, but the actual tokenization is done differently. 💡 This section covers WordPiece in depth, going as far as showing a full implementation. You can skip to the end if you just want a general overview of the tokenization algorithm. ## Training algorithm[[training-algorithm]]\\n⚠️ Google never open-sourced its implementation of the training algorithm of WordPiece, so what follows is our best guess based on the published literature. It may not be 100% accurate. Like BPE, WordPiece starts from a small vocabulary including the special tokens used by the model and the initial alphabet. Since it identifies subwords by adding a prefix (like `##` for BERT), each word is initially split by adding that prefix to all the characters inside the word. So, for instance, `\"word\"` gets split like this:\\n```\\nw ##o ##r ##d\\n```\\nThus, the initial alphabet contains all the characters present at the beginning of a word and the characters present inside a word preceded by the WordPiece prefix. Then, again like BPE, WordPiece learns merge rules. The main difference is the way the pair to be merged is selected. Instead of selecting the most frequent pair, WordPiece computes a score for each pair, using the following formula:\\n$$\\\\mathrm{score} = (\\\\mathrm{freq\\\\\\\\_of\\\\\\\\_pair}) / (\\\\mathrm{freq\\\\\\\\_of\\\\\\\\_first\\\\\\\\_element} \\\\times \\\\mathrm{freq\\\\\\\\_of\\\\\\\\_second\\\\\\\\_element})$$\\nBy dividing the frequency of the pair by the product of the frequencies of each of its parts, the algorithm prioritizes the merging of pairs where the individual parts are less frequent in the vocabulary.\\n\\nWith this kind of tokenizer, we can end up with some pretty large \"vocabularies,\" where a vocabulary is defined by the total number of independent tokens that we have in our corpus. Each word gets assigned an ID, starting from 0 and going up to the size of the vocabulary. The model uses these IDs to identify each word. If we want to completely cover a language with a word-based tokenizer, we\\'ll need to have an identifier for each word in the language, which will generate a huge amount of tokens. For example, there are over 500,000 words in the English language, so to build a map from each word to an input ID we\\'d need to keep track of that many IDs. Furthermore, words like \"dog\" are represented differently from words like \"dogs\", and the model will initially have no way of knowing that \"dog\" and \"dogs\" are similar: it will identify the two words as unrelated. The same applies to other similar words, like \"run\" and \"running\", which the model will not see as being similar initially. Finally, we need a custom token to represent words that are not in our vocabulary. This is known as the \"unknown\" token, often represented as \"[UNK]\" or \"<unk>\". It\\'s generally a bad sign if you see that the tokenizer is producing a lot of these tokens, as it wasn\\'t able to retrieve a sensible representation of a word and you\\'re losing information along the way. The goal when crafting the vocabulary is to do it in such a way that the tokenizer tokenizes as few words as possible into the unknown token. One way to reduce the amount of unknown tokens is to go one level deeper, using a \\\\_character-based\\\\_ tokenizer. ## Character-based[[character-based]]\\nCharacter-based tokenizers split the text into characters, rather than words. This has two primary benefits:\\n- The vocabulary is much smaller. - There are much fewer out-of-vocabulary (unknown) tokens, since every word can be built from characters. But here too some questions arise concerning spaces and punctuation:\\n\\n![An example of character-based tokenization.](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-course/documentation-images/resolve/main/en/chapter2/character_based_tokenization.svg)\\n![An example of character-based tokenization.](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-course/documentation-images/resolve/main/en/chapter2/character_based_tokenization-dark.svg)\\n\\nThis approach isn\\'t perfect either. Since the representation is now based on characters rather than words, one could argue that, intuitively, it\\'s less meaningful: each character doesn\\'t mean a lot on its own, whereas that is the case with words. However, this again differs according to the language; in Chinese, for example, each character carries more information than a character in a Latin language. Another thing to consider is that we\\'ll end up with a very large amount of tokens to be processed by our model: whereas a word would only be a single token with a word-based tokenizer, it can easily turn into 10 or more tokens when converted into characters. To get the best of both worlds, we can use a third technique that combines the two approaches: \\\\*subword tokenization\\\\*. ## Subword tokenization[[subword-tokenization]]\\nSubword tokenization algorithms rely on the principle that frequently used words should not be split into smaller subwords, but rare words should be decomposed into meaningful subwords. For instance, \"annoyingly\" might be considered a rare word and could be decomposed into \"annoying\" and \"ly\". These are both likely to appear more frequently as standalone subwords, while at the same time the meaning of \"annoyingly\" is kept by the composite meaning of \"annoying\" and \"ly\". Here is an example showing how a subword tokenization algorithm would tokenize the sequence \"Let\\'s do tokenization!\":\\n\\n![A subword tokenization algorithm.](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-course/documentation-images/resolve/main/en/chapter2/bpe_subword.svg)\\n![A subword tokenization algorithm.](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-course/documentation-images/resolve/main/en/chapter2/bpe_subword-dark.svg)\\n\\nThese subwords end up providing a lot of semantic meaning: for instance, in the example above \"tokenization\" was split into \"token\" and \"ization\", two tokens that have a semantic meaning while being space-efficient (only two tokens are needed to represent a long word).', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': 'cc4eec5f-a904-47a1-94b2-dd1016dac428', 'tool_call_id': 'call_aEAcQ7IXVuYFsNkHCnhfC1C7', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689aaa303e684812d15f5e18', 'page_content': 'In turn, the model will now be able to make sense of token in different situations.

Capturing these \"hard\" data points is valuable because it allows you to improve your machine learning model and make it more reliable and robust. Gradio simplifies the collection of this data by including a \\\\*\\\\*Flag\\\\*\\\\* button with every `Interface`. This allows a user or tester to easily send data back to the machine where the demo is running. In this Guide, we discuss more about how to use the flagging feature, both with `gradio.Interface` as well as with `gradio.Blocks`. ## The \\\\*\\\\*Flag\\\\*\\\\* button in `gradio.Interface`\\nFlagging with Gradio\\'s `Interface` is especially easy. By default, underneath the output components, there is a button marked \\\\*\\\\*Flag\\\\*\\\\*. When a user testing your model sees input with interesting output, they can click the flag button to send the input and output data back to the machine where the demo is running. The sample is saved to a CSV log file (by default). If the demo involves images, audio, video, or other types of files, these are saved separately in a parallel directory and the paths to these files are saved in the CSV file. There are [four parameters](https://gradio.app/docs/#interface-header) in `gradio.Interface` that control how flagging works. We will go over them in greater detail. - `allow\\\\_flagging`: this parameter can be set to either `\"manual\"` (default), `\"auto\"`, or `\"never\"`. - `manual`: users will see a button to flag, and samples are only flagged when the button is clicked. - `auto`: users will not see a button to flag, but every sample will be flagged automatically. - `never`: users will not see a button to flag, and no sample will be flagged. - `flagging\\\\_options`: this parameter can be either `None` (default) or a list of strings. - If `None`, then the user simply clicks on the \\\\*\\\\*Flag\\\\*\\\\* button and no additional options are shown. - If a list of strings are provided, then the user sees several buttons, corresponding to each of the strings that are provided. For example, if the value of this parameter is `[\"Incorrect\", \"Ambiguous\"]`, then buttons labeled \\\\*\\\\*Flag as Incorrect\\\\*\\\\* and \\\\*\\\\*Flag as Ambiguous\\\\*\\\\* appear. This only applies if `allow\\\\_flagging` is `\"manual\"`. - The chosen option is then logged along with the input and output. - `flagging\\\\_dir`: this parameter takes a string. - It represents what to name the directory where flagged data is stored. - `flagging\\\\_callback`: this parameter takes an instance of a subclass of the `FlaggingCallback` class\\n- Using this parameter allows you to write custom code that gets run when the flag button is clicked\\n- By default, this is set to an instance of `gr.CSVLogger`\\n- One example is setting it to an instance of `gr.HuggingFaceDatasetSaver` which can allow you to pipe any flagged data into a HuggingFace Dataset.\\n\\n- `description`: which accepts text, markdown or HTML and places it right under the title. - `article`: which also accepts text, markdown or HTML and places it below the interface. ![annotated](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/guides/assets/annotated.png?raw=true)\\nIf you\\'re using the `Blocks` API instead, you can insert text, markdown, or HTML anywhere using the `gr.Markdown(...)` or `gr.HTML(...)` components, with descriptive content inside the `Component` constructor. Another useful keyword argument is `label=`, which is present in every `Component`. This modifies the label text at the top of each `Component`. You can also add the `info=` keyword argument to form elements like `Textbox` or `Radio` to provide further information on their usage. ```python\\ngr.Number(label=\\'Age\\', info=\\'In years, must be greater than 0\\')\\n```\\n## Flagging\\nBy default, an `Interface` will have \"Flag\" button. When a user testing your `Interface` sees input with interesting output, such as erroneous or unexpected model behaviour, they can flag the input for you to review. Within the directory provided by the `flagging\\\\_dir=` argument to the `Interface` constructor, a CSV file will log the flagged inputs. If the interface involves file data, such as for Image and Audio components, folders will be created to store those flagged data as well. For example, with the calculator interface shown above, we would have the flagged data stored in the flagged directory shown below:\\n```directory\\n+-- calculator.py\\n+-- flagged/\\n| +-- logs.csv\\n```\\n\\\\_flagged/logs.csv\\\\_\\n```csv\\nnum1,operation,num2,Output\\n5,add,7,12\\n6,subtract,1.5,4.5\\n```\\nWith the sepia interface shown earlier, we would have the flagged data stored in the flagged directory shown below:\\n```directory\\n+-- sepia.py\\n+-- flagged/\\n| +-- logs.csv\\n| +-- im/\\n| | +-- 0.png\\n| | +-- 1.png\\n| +-- Output/\\n| | +-- 0.png\\n| | +-- 1.png\\n```\\n\\\\_flagged/logs.csv\\\\_\\n```csv\\nim,Output\\nim/0.png,Output/0.png\\nim/1.png,Output/1.png\\n```\\nIf you wish for the user to provide a reason for flagging, you can pass a list of strings to the `flagging\\\\_options` argument of Interface. Users will have to select one of the strings when flagging, which will be saved as an additional column to the CSV.\\n\\nFor example, on Hugging Face\\nSpaces, developers typically don\\'t have access to the underlying ephemeral machine hosting the Gradio\\ndemo. That\\'s why, by default, flagging is turned off in Hugging Face Space. However,\\nyou may want to do something else with the flagged data. We\\'ve made this super easy with the `flagging\\\\_callback` parameter. For example, below we\\'re going to pipe flagged data from our calculator example into a Hugging Face Dataset, e.g. so that we can build a \"crowd-sourced\" dataset:\\n```python\\nimport os\\nHF\\\\_TOKEN = os.getenv(\\'HF\\\\_TOKEN\\')\\nhf\\\\_writer = gr.HuggingFaceDatasetSaver(HF\\\\_TOKEN, \"crowdsourced-calculator-demo\")\\niface = gr.Interface(\\ncalculator,\\n[\"number\", gr.Radio([\"add\", \"subtract\", \"multiply\", \"divide\"]), \"number\"],\\n\"number\",\\ndescription=\"Check out the crowd-sourced dataset at: [https://huggingface.co/datasets/aliabd/crowdsourced-calculator-demo](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aliabd/crowdsourced-calculator-demo)\",\\nallow\\\\_flagging=\"manual\",\\nflagging\\\\_options=[\"wrong sign\", \"off by one\", \"other\"],\\nflagging\\\\_callback=hf\\\\_writer\\n)\\niface.launch()\\n```\\nNotice that we define our own\\ninstance of `gradio.HuggingFaceDatasetSaver` using our Hugging Face token and\\nthe name of a dataset we\\'d like to save samples to. In addition, we also set `allow\\\\_flagging=\"manual\"`\\nbecause on Hugging Face Spaces, `allow\\\\_flagging` is set to `\"never\"` by default. Here\\'s our demo:\\nYou can now see all the examples flagged above in this [public Hugging Face dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aliabd/crowdsourced-calculator-demo). ![flagging callback hf](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/guides/assets/flagging-callback-hf.png?raw=true)\\nWe created the `gradio.HuggingFaceDatasetSaver` class, but you can pass your own custom class as long as it inherits from `FLaggingCallback` defined in [this file](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/master/gradio/flagging.py). If you create a cool callback, contribute it to the repo! ## Flagging with Blocks\\nWhat about if you are using `gradio.Blocks`? On one hand, you have even more flexibility\\nwith Blocks -- you can write whatever Python code you want to run when a button is clicked,\\nand assign that using the built-in events in Blocks.\\n\\n- \\\\*\\\\*Files that you explicitly allow via the `allowed\\\\_paths` parameter in `launch()`\\\\*\\\\*. This parameter allows you to pass in a list of additional directories or exact filepaths you\\'d like to allow users to have access to. (By default, this parameter is an empty list). Gradio DOES NOT ALLOW access to:\\n- \\\\*\\\\*Files that you explicitly block via the `blocked\\\\_paths` parameter in `launch()`\\\\*\\\\*. You can pass in a list of additional directories or exact filepaths to the `blocked\\\\_paths` parameter in `launch()`. This parameter takes precedence over the files that Gradio exposes by default or by the `allowed\\\\_paths`. - \\\\*\\\\*Any other paths on the host machine\\\\*\\\\*. Users should NOT be able to access other arbitrary paths on the host.

FocalNets completely replace self-attention (used in models like [ViT](vit) and [Swin](swin)) by a focal modulation mechanism for modeling token interactions in vision. The authors claim that FocalNets outperform self-attention based models with similar computational costs on the tasks of image classification, object detection, and segmentation. The abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*We propose focal modulation networks (FocalNets in short), where self-attention (SA) is completely replaced by a focal modulation mechanism for modeling token interactions in vision. Focal modulation comprises three components: (i) hierarchical contextualization, implemented using a stack of depth-wise convolutional layers, to encode visual contexts from short to long ranges, (ii) gated aggregation to selectively gather contexts for each query token based on its\\ncontent, and (iii) element-wise modulation or affine transformation to inject the aggregated context into the query. Extensive experiments show FocalNets outperform the state-of-the-art SA counterparts (e.g., Swin and Focal Transformers) with similar computational costs on the tasks of image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Specifically, FocalNets with tiny and base size achieve 82.3% and 83.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. After pretrained on ImageNet-22K in 224 resolution, it attains 86.5% and 87.3% top-1 accuracy when finetuned with resolution 224 and 384, respectively. When transferred to downstream tasks, FocalNets exhibit clear superiority. For object detection with Mask R-CNN, FocalNet base trained with 1\\\\times outperforms the Swin counterpart by 2.1 points and already surpasses Swin trained with 3\\\\times schedule (49.0 v.s. 48.5). For semantic segmentation with UPerNet, FocalNet base at single-scale outperforms Swin by 2.4, and beats Swin at multi-scale (50.5 v.s. 49.7). Using large FocalNet and Mask2former, we achieve 58.5 mIoU for ADE20K semantic segmentation, and 57.9 PQ for COCO Panoptic Segmentation. Using huge FocalNet and DINO, we achieved 64.3 and 64.4 mAP on COCO minival and test-dev, respectively, establishing new SoTA on top of much larger attention-based models like Swinv2-G and BEIT-3.\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [nielsr](https://huggingface.co/nielsr).\\n\\n!--Copyright 2020 The HuggingFace Team.

It\\'s a\\nbidirectional transformer pretrained using a combination of masked language modeling objective and next sentence\\nprediction on a large corpus comprising the Toronto Book Corpus and Wikipedia. The abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations\\nfrom Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional\\nrepresentations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result,\\nthe pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models\\nfor a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific\\narchitecture modifications.\\\\*\\n\\\\*BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural\\nlanguage processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI\\naccuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute\\nimprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [thomwolf](https://huggingface.co/thomwolf).\\n\\nThe original code can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/bert). ## Usage tips\\n- BERT is a model with absolute position embeddings so it\\'s usually advised to pad the inputs on the right rather than\\nthe left. - BERT was trained with the masked language modeling (MLM) and next sentence prediction (NSP) objectives. It is\\nefficient at predicting masked tokens and at NLU in general, but is not optimal for text generation. - Corrupts the inputs by using random masking, more precisely, during pretraining, a given percentage of tokens (usually 15%) is masked by:\\n\\\\* a special mask token with probability 0.8\\n\\\\* a random token different from the one masked with probability 0.1\\n\\\\* the same token with probability 0.1\\n- The model must predict the original sentence, but has a second objective: inputs are two sentences A and B (with a separation token in between). With probability 50%, the sentences are consecutive in the corpus, in the remaining 50% they are not related. The model has to predict if the sentences are consecutive or not. ## Resources\\nA list of official Hugging Face and community (indicated by 🌎) resources to help you get started with BERT.', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': 'f8388cf2-7c23-48bd-a246-882ce8b7ea2f', 'tool_call_id': 'call_5txv6TH0oyl9DSBZK70n5pPh', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '6899c123666af48523f51fc0', 'page_content': '!--Copyright 2021 The HuggingFace Team.

Using huge FocalNet and DINO, we achieved 64.3 and 64.4 mAP on COCO minival and test-dev, respectively, establishing new SoTA on top of much larger attention-based models like Swinv2-G and BEIT-3.\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [nielsr](https://huggingface.co/nielsr).', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689abb613e684812d15f71e1', 'page_content': '!--Copyright 2020 The HuggingFace Team.

It\\'s a\\nbidirectional transformer pretrained using a combination of masked language modeling objective and next sentence\\nprediction on a large corpus comprising the Toronto Book Corpus and Wikipedia. The abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations\\nfrom Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional\\nrepresentations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result,\\nthe pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models\\nfor a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific\\narchitecture modifications.\\\\*\\n\\\\*BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural\\nlanguage processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI\\naccuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute\\nimprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [thomwolf](https://huggingface.co/thomwolf).', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689abb613e684812d15f71e2', 'page_content': \"The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/bert). ## Usage tips\\n- BERT is a model with absolute position embeddings so it's usually advised to pad the inputs on the right rather than\\nthe left. - BERT was trained with the masked language modeling (MLM) and next sentence prediction (NSP) objectives. It is\\nefficient at predicting masked tokens and at NLU in general, but is not optimal for text generation. - Corrupts the inputs by using random masking, more precisely, during pretraining, a given percentage of tokens (usually 15%) is masked by:\\n\\\\* a special mask token with probability 0.8\\n\\\\* a random token different from the one masked with probability 0.1\\n\\\\* the same token with probability 0.1\\n- The model must predict the original sentence, but has a second objective: inputs are two sentences A and B (with a separation token in between). With probability 50%, the sentences are consecutive in the corpus, in the remaining 50% they are not related. The model has to predict if the sentences are consecutive or not. ## Resources\\nA list of official Hugging Face and community (indicated by 🌎) resources to help you get started with BERT.\", 'type': 'Document'}}], 'status': 'success'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'messages', 'AIMessage'], 'kwargs': {'content': 'The FNet model replaces the self-attention layer in a BERT model with a Fourier transform, which returns only the real parts of the transform.', 'response_metadata': {'finish_reason': 'stop', 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_34a54ae93c'}, 'type': 'ai', 'id': 'run--0e1238b9-e28b-45a3-a713-a39f30c4460f-0', 'usage_metadata': {'input_tokens': 2924, 'output_tokens': 30, 'total_tokens': 2954, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}, 'tool_calls': [], 'invalid_tool_calls': []}}], 'chat_history': []}\n"

Although the gradients are also computed in half precision they are converted back to full precision for the optimization\\nstep so no memory is saved here. While mixed precision training results in faster computations, it can also lead to more GPU memory being utilized, especially for small batch sizes. This is because the model is now present on the GPU in both 16-bit and 32-bit precision (1.5x the original model on the GPU).

The `Model`: in charge of doing the actual tokenization. An example of a `Model` would be\\n`BPE` or `WordPiece`.\\n\\nThe tokenization pipeline\\nWhen calling `Tokenizer.encode` or\\n`Tokenizer.encode\\\\_batch`, the input\\ntext(s) go through the following pipeline:\\n- `normalization`\\n- `pre-tokenization`\\n- `model`\\n- `post-processing`\\nWe\\'ll see in details what happens during each of those steps in detail,\\nas well as when you want to `decode ` some token ids, and how the 🤗 Tokenizers library allows you\\nto customize each of those steps to your needs. If you\\'re already\\nfamiliar with those steps and want to learn by seeing some code, jump to\\n`our BERT from scratch example `. For the examples that require a `Tokenizer` we will use the tokenizer we trained in the\\n`quicktour`, which you can load with:\\n\\n{\"path\": \"../../bindings/python/tests/documentation/test\\\\_pipeline.py\",\\n\"language\": \"python\",\\n\"start-after\": \"START reload\\\\_tokenizer\",\\n\"end-before\": \"END reload\\\\_tokenizer\",\\n\"dedent\": 12}\\n\\n{\"path\": \"../../tokenizers/tests/documentation.rs\",\\n\"language\": \"rust\",\\n\"start-after\": \"START pipeline\\\\_reload\\\\_tokenizer\",\\n\"end-before\": \"END pipeline\\\\_reload\\\\_tokenizer\",\\n\"dedent\": 4}\\n\\n{\"path\": \"../../bindings/node/examples/documentation/pipeline.test.ts\",\\n\"language\": \"js\",\\n\"start-after\": \"START reload\\\\_tokenizer\",\\n\"end-before\": \"END reload\\\\_tokenizer\",\\n\"dedent\": 8}\\n## Normalization\\nNormalization is, in a nutshell, a set of operations you apply to a raw\\nstring to make it less random or \"cleaner\".\\n\\nn these few videos, we\\'ll take a look at the tokenizers. In Natural Language Processing, most of the data that we handle consists of raw text. However, machine learning models cannot read and understand text in its raw form they can only work with numbers. The tokenizer\\'s objective will be to translate the text into numbers. There are several possible approaches to this conversion, and the objective is to find the most meaningful representation. We\\'ll take a look at three distinct tokenization algorithms. We compare them one to one, so we recommend you look at the videos in the following order: Word-based, Character-based, and Subword-based.\\n\\nhe fast tokenizers of the Transformers library are fast, but they also implement features that will be super useful for data pre-processing and post-processing. Let\\'s have a look at them! First, let\\'s have a look at the usual output of a tokenizer. We get input IDs that correspond to tokens, but we lose a lot of information in the process. For instance, here the tokenization is the same for the two sentences, even if one has several more spaces than the other. Just having the input IDs is thus not enough if we want to match some tokens with a span of text (something we will need to do when tackling question answering for instance). It\\'s also difficult to know when two tokens belong to the same word or not: it looks easy when you just look at the output of a BERT tokenizer, we just need to look for the ##. But other tokenizers have different ways to tokenize parts of words. For instance RoBERTa adds this special G symbol to mark the tokens at the beginning of a word, and T5 uses this special underscore symbol for the same purpose.', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': '673cd249-a123-40cd-b005-4a30aa954993', 'tool_call_id': 'call_nZzi4Pv5OmdxWMai7Cofp9oA', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '6899bb92af3d2ebb270a0a21', 'page_content': 'p align=\"center\">\\n\\n![](https://huggingface.co/landing/assets/tokenizers/tokenizers-logo.png)\\n\\n![Build](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/workflows/Rust/badge.svg)\\n[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/huggingface/tokenizers.svg?color=blue)](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/blob/master/LICENSE)\\n[![Doc](https://docs.rs/tokenizers/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/tokenizers/)\\n\\nThe core of `tokenizers`, written in Rust.

For instance, here the tokenization is the same for the two sentences, even if one has several more spaces than the other. Just having the input IDs is thus not enough if we want to match some tokens with a span of text (something we will need to do when tackling question answering for instance). It's also difficult to know when two tokens belong to the same word or not: it looks easy when you just look at the output of a BERT tokenizer, we just need to look for the ##.

Visit [the dedicated documentation page](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/repositories-pull-requests-discussions)\\nfor a deeper view of what Discussions and Pull Requests on the Hub are, and how they work under the hood. ## Retrieve Discussions and Pull Requests from the Hub\\nThe `HfApi` class allows you to retrieve Discussions and Pull Requests on a given repo:\\n```python\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import get\\\\_repo\\\\_discussions\\n>>> for discussion in get\\\\_repo\\\\_discussions(repo\\\\_id=\"bigscience/bloom\"):\\n... print(f\"{discussion.num} - {discussion.title}, pr: {discussion.is\\\\_pull\\\\_request}\")\\n# 11 - Add Flax weights, pr: True\\n# 10 - Update README.md, pr: True\\n# 9 - Training languages in the model card, pr: True\\n# 8 - Update tokenizer\\\\_config.json, pr: True\\n# 7 - Slurm training script, pr: False\\n[...]\\n```\\n`HfApi.get\\\\_repo\\\\_discussions` supports filtering by author, type (Pull Request or Discussion) and status (`open` or `closed`):\\n```python\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import get\\\\_repo\\\\_discussions\\n>>> for discussion in get\\\\_repo\\\\_discussions(\\n...\\n\\nrepo\\\\_id=\"bigscience/bloom\",\\n... author=\"ArthurZ\",\\n... discussion\\\\_type=\"pull\\\\_request\",\\n... discussion\\\\_status=\"open\",\\n... ):\\n... print(f\"{discussion.num} - {discussion.title} by {discussion.author}, pr: {discussion.is\\\\_pull\\\\_request}\")\\n# 19 - Add Flax weights by ArthurZ, pr: True\\n```\\n`HfApi.get\\\\_repo\\\\_discussions` returns a [generator](https://docs.python.org/3.7/howto/functional.html#generators) that yields\\n[`Discussion`] objects. To get all the Discussions in a single list, run:\\n```python\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import get\\\\_repo\\\\_discussions\\n>>> discussions\\\\_list = list(get\\\\_repo\\\\_discussions(repo\\\\_id=\"bert-base-uncased\"))\\n```\\nThe [`Discussion`] object returned by [`HfApi.get\\\\_repo\\\\_discussions`] contains high-level overview of the\\nDiscussion or Pull Request. You can also get more detailed information using [`HfApi.get\\\\_discussion\\\\_details`]:\\n```python\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import get\\\\_discussion\\\\_details\\n>>> get\\\\_discussion\\\\_details(\\n... repo\\\\_id=\"bigscience/bloom-1b3\",\\n... discussion\\\\_num=2\\n... )\\nDiscussionWithDetails(\\nnum=2,\\nauthor=\\'cakiki\\',\\ntitle=\\'Update VRAM memory for the V100s\\',\\nstatus=\\'open\\',\\nis\\\\_pull\\\\_request=True,\\nevents=[\\nDiscussionComment(type=\\'comment\\', author=\\'cakiki\\', ...),\\nDiscussionCommit(type=\\'commit\\', author=\\'cakiki\\', summary=\\'Update VRAM memory for the V100s\\', oid=\\'1256f9d9a33fa8887e1c1bf0e09b4713da96773a\\', ...),\\n],\\nconflicting\\\\_files=[],\\ntarget\\\\_branch=\\'refs/heads/main\\',\\nmerge\\\\_commit\\\\_oid=None,\\ndiff=\\'diff --git a/README.md b/README.md\\\\nindex a6ae3b9294edf8d0eda0d67c7780a10241242a7e..3a1814f212bc3f0d3cc8f74bdbd316de4ae7b9e3 100644\\\\n--- a/README.md\\\\n+++ b/README.md\\\\n@@ -132,7 +132,7 [...]\\',\\n)\\n```\\n[`HfApi.get\\\\_discussion\\\\_details`] returns a [`DiscussionWithDetails`] object, which is a subclass of [`Discussion`]\\nwith more detailed information about the Discussion or Pull Request. Information includes all the comments, status changes,\\nand renames of the Discussion via [`DiscussionWithDetails.events`]. In case of a Pull Request, you can retrieve the raw git diff with [`DiscussionWithDetails.diff`]. All the commits of the\\nPull Request are listed in [`DiscussionWithDetails.events`]. ## Create and edit a Discussion or Pull Request programmatically\\nThe [`HfApi`] class also offers ways to create and edit Discussions and Pull Requests. You will need an [access token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens) to create and edit Discussions\\nor Pull Requests. The simplest way to propose changes on a repo on the Hub is via the [`create\\\\_commit`] API: just\\nset the `create\\\\_pr` parameter to `True`.

Visit [the dedicated documentation page](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/repositories-pull-requests-discussions)\\nfor a deeper view of what Discussions and Pull Requests on the Hub are, and how they work under the hood. ## Retrieve Discussions and Pull Requests from the Hub\\nThe `HfApi` class allows you to retrieve Discussions and Pull Requests on a given repo:\\n```python\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import get\\\\_repo\\\\_discussions\\n>>> for discussion in get\\\\_repo\\\\_discussions(repo\\\\_id=\"bigscience/bloom\"):\\n... print(f\"{discussion.num} - {discussion.title}, pr: {discussion.is\\\\_pull\\\\_request}\")\\n# 11 - Add Flax weights, pr: True\\n# 10 - Update README.md, pr: True\\n# 9 - Training languages in the model card, pr: True\\n# 8 - Update tokenizer\\\\_config.json, pr: True\\n# 7 - Slurm training script, pr: False\\n[...]\\n```\\n`HfApi.get\\\\_repo\\\\_discussions` supports filtering by author, type (Pull Request or Discussion) and status (`open` or `closed`):\\n```python\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import get\\\\_repo\\\\_discussions\\n>>> for discussion in get\\\\_repo\\\\_discussions(\\n...', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689aae903e684812d15f6355', 'page_content': 'repo\\\\_id=\"bigscience/bloom\",\\n... author=\"ArthurZ\",\\n... discussion\\\\_type=\"pull\\\\_request\",\\n... discussion\\\\_status=\"open\",\\n... ):\\n... print(f\"{discussion.num} - {discussion.title} by {discussion.author}, pr: {discussion.is\\\\_pull\\\\_request}\")\\n# 19 - Add Flax weights by ArthurZ, pr: True\\n```\\n`HfApi.get\\\\_repo\\\\_discussions` returns a [generator](https://docs.python.org/3.7/howto/functional.html#generators) that yields\\n[`Discussion`] objects. To get all the Discussions in a single list, run:\\n```python\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import get\\\\_repo\\\\_discussions\\n>>> discussions\\\\_list = list(get\\\\_repo\\\\_discussions(repo\\\\_id=\"bert-base-uncased\"))\\n```\\nThe [`Discussion`] object returned by [`HfApi.get\\\\_repo\\\\_discussions`] contains high-level overview of the\\nDiscussion or Pull Request. You can also get more detailed information using [`HfApi.get\\\\_discussion\\\\_details`]:\\n```python\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import get\\\\_discussion\\\\_details\\n>>> get\\\\_discussion\\\\_details(\\n... repo\\\\_id=\"bigscience/bloom-1b3\",\\n... discussion\\\\_num=2\\n... )\\nDiscussionWithDetails(\\nnum=2,\\nauthor=\\'cakiki\\',\\ntitle=\\'Update VRAM memory for the V100s\\',\\nstatus=\\'open\\',\\nis\\\\_pull\\\\_request=True,\\nevents=[\\nDiscussionComment(type=\\'comment\\', author=\\'cakiki\\', ...),\\nDiscussionCommit(type=\\'commit\\', author=\\'cakiki\\', summary=\\'Update VRAM memory for the V100s\\', oid=\\'1256f9d9a33fa8887e1c1bf0e09b4713da96773a\\', ...),\\n],\\nconflicting\\\\_files=[],\\ntarget\\\\_branch=\\'refs/heads/main\\',\\nmerge\\\\_commit\\\\_oid=None,\\ndiff=\\'diff --git a/README.md b/README.md\\\\nindex a6ae3b9294edf8d0eda0d67c7780a10241242a7e..3a1814f212bc3f0d3cc8f74bdbd316de4ae7b9e3 100644\\\\n--- a/README.md\\\\n+++ b/README.md\\\\n@@ -132,7 +132,7 [...]\\',\\n)\\n```\\n[`HfApi.get\\\\_discussion\\\\_details`] returns a [`DiscussionWithDetails`] object, which is a subclass of [`Discussion`]\\nwith more detailed information about the Discussion or Pull Request. Information includes all the comments, status changes,\\nand renames of the Discussion via [`DiscussionWithDetails.events`]. In case of a Pull Request, you can retrieve the raw git diff with [`DiscussionWithDetails.diff`]. All the commits of the\\nPull Request are listed in [`DiscussionWithDetails.events`]. ## Create and edit a Discussion or Pull Request programmatically\\nThe [`HfApi`] class also offers ways to create and edit Discussions and Pull Requests. You will need an [access token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens) to create and edit Discussions\\nor Pull Requests. The simplest way to propose changes on a repo on the Hub is via the [`create\\\\_commit`] API: just\\nset the `create\\\\_pr` parameter to `True`. This parameter is also available on other methods that wrap [`create\\\\_commit`]:\\n\\\\* [`upload\\\\_file`]\\n\\\\* [`upload\\\\_folder`]\\n\\\\* [`delete\\\\_file`]\\n\\\\* [`delete\\\\_folder`]\\n\\\\* [`metadata\\\\_update`]\\n```python\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import metadata\\\\_update\\n>>> metadata\\\\_update(\\n...', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689aae903e684812d15f6356', 'page_content': 'repo\\\\_id=\"username/repo\\\\_name\",\\n... metadata={\"tags\": [\"computer-vision\", \"awesome-model\"]},\\n... create\\\\_pr=True,\\n... )\\n```\\nYou can also use [`HfApi.create\\\\_discussion`] (respectively [`HfApi.create\\\\_pull\\\\_request`]) to create a Discussion (respectively a Pull Request) on a repo.

Before you begin, we recommend you create a [Hugging Face account](https://huggingface.co/join) from which you can manage your repositories and files. If you need help with the integration, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface\\\\_hub/issues/new/choose), and we would be more than happy to help you. ## Installation\\n1. Install the `huggingface\\\\_hub` library with pip in your environment:\\n```bash\\npython -m pip install huggingface\\\\_hub\\n```\\n2. Once you have successfully installed the `huggingface\\\\_hub` library, log in to your Hugging Face account:\\n```bash\\nhuggingface-cli login\\n```\\n```bash\\n\\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_|\\\\_|\\\\_| \\\\_|\\\\_|\\\\_| \\\\_|\\\\_|\\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_|\\\\_|\\\\_| \\\\_|\\\\_|\\\\_|\\\\_| \\\\_|\\\\_| \\\\_|\\\\_|\\\\_| \\\\_|\\\\_|\\\\_|\\\\_|\\n\\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_|\\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_|\\n\\\\_|\\\\_|\\\\_|\\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_|\\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_|\\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_|\\\\_| \\\\_|\\\\_|\\\\_| \\\\_|\\\\_|\\\\_|\\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_|\\\\_|\\\\_|\\n\\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_|\\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_|\\n\\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_|\\\\_| \\\\_|\\\\_|\\\\_| \\\\_|\\\\_|\\\\_| \\\\_|\\\\_|\\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_|\\\\_|\\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_| \\\\_|\\\\_|\\\\_| \\\\_|\\\\_|\\\\_|\\\\_|\\nUsername:\\nPassword:\\n```\\n3. Alternatively, if you prefer working from a Jupyter or Colaboratory notebook, login with `notebook\\\\_login`:\\n```python\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import notebook\\\\_login\\n>>> notebook\\\\_login()\\n```\\n`notebook\\\\_login` will launch a widget in your notebook from which you can enter your Hugging Face credentials.\\n\\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/code_snippet.png)\\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/code_snippet-dark.png)\\n\\nFirst, register your library by editing [model-libaries.ts](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface.js/blob/main/packages/tasks/src/model-libraries.ts). Then, add a code snippet by updating the [library-ui-elements](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface.js/blob/main/packages/tasks/src/library-ui-elements.ts) file with instructions for your model. For example, the [Asteroid](https://huggingface.co/asteroid-team) integration includes a brief code snippet for how to load and use an Asteroid model:\\n```typescript\\nconst asteroid = (model: ModelData) =>\\n`from asteroid.models import BaseModel\\nmodel = BaseModel.from\\\\_pretrained(\"${model.id}\")`;\\n```\\nDoing so will also add a tag to your model so users can quickly identify models from your library. ![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/libraries-tags.png)\\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/libraries-tags-dark.png)\\n\\n## Upload files to the Hub\\nYou might also want to provide a method for creating model repositories and uploading files to the Hub directly from your library. The `huggingface\\\\_hub` library offers two ways to assist you with creating repositories and uploading files:\\n- `create\\\\_repo` creates a repository on the Hub. - `upload\\\\_file` directly uploads files to a repository on the Hub. ### `create\\\\_repo`\\nThe `create\\\\_repo` method creates a repository on the Hub. Use the `name` parameter to provide a name for your repository:\\n```python\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import create\\\\_repo\\n>>> create\\\\_repo(repo\\\\_id=\"test-model\")\\n\\'https://huggingface.co/lysandre/test-model\\'\\n```\\nWhen you check your Hugging Face account, you should now see a `test-model` repository under your namespace.\\n\\n## Integrating to the Hub. We\\'re partnering with cool open source ML libraries to provide free model hosting and versioning. You can find the existing integrations [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/libraries). The advantages are:\\n- Free model or dataset hosting for libraries and their users. - Built-in file versioning, even with very large files, thanks to a git-based approach. - Hosted inference API for all models publicly available. - In-browser widgets to play with the uploaded models. - Anyone can upload a new model for your library, they just need to add the corresponding tag for the model to be discoverable. - Fast downloads! We use Cloudfront (a CDN) to geo-replicate downloads so they\\'re blazing fast from anywhere on the globe. - Usage stats and more features to come. If you would like to integrate your library, feel free to open an issue to begin the discussion. We wrote a [step-by-step guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/adding-a-library) with ❤️ showing how to do this integration. ## Contributions (feature requests, bugs, etc.) are super welcome 💙💚💛💜🧡❤️\\nEveryone is welcome to contribute, and we value everybody\\'s contribution. Code is not the only way to help the community. Answering questions, helping others, reaching out and improving the documentations are immensely valuable to the community. We wrote a [contribution guide](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface\\\\_hub/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to summarize\\nhow to get started to contribute to this repository.\\n\\nThe Hugging Face Hub[[the-hugging-face-hub]]\\nThe [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/) –- our main website –- is a central platform that enables anyone to discover, use, and contribute new state-of-the-art models and datasets. It hosts a wide variety of models, with more than 10,000 publicly available. We\\'ll focus on the models in this chapter, and take a look at the datasets in Chapter 5. The models in the Hub are not limited to 🤗 Transformers or even NLP. There are models from [Flair](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair) and [AllenNLP](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp) for NLP, [Asteroid](https://github.com/asteroid-team/asteroid) and [pyannote](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio) for speech, and [timm](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models) for vision, to name a few. Each of these models is hosted as a Git repository, which allows versioning and reproducibility. Sharing a model on the Hub means opening it up to the community and making it accessible to anyone looking to easily use it, in turn eliminating their need to train a model on their own and simplifying sharing and usage. Additionally, sharing a model on the Hub automatically deploys a hosted Inference API for that model. Anyone in the community is free to test it out directly on the model\\'s page, with custom inputs and appropriate widgets. The best part is that sharing and using any public model on the Hub is completely free! [Paid plans](https://huggingface.co/pricing) also exist if you wish to share models privately. The video below shows how to navigate the Hub. Having a huggingface.co account is required to follow along this part, as we\\'ll be creating and managing repositories on the Hugging Face Hub: [create an account](https://huggingface.co/join)', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': 'cef1db78-f325-479e-8943-3fb315b0e47a', 'tool_call_id': 'call_P66XtXPzpVeVs9EBdwzOiP9W', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '6899c0d8666af48523f51f5a', 'page_content': 'Integrate your library with the Hub\\nThe Hugging Face Hub aims to facilitate sharing machine learning models, checkpoints, and artifacts.

Use the `name` parameter to provide a name for your repository:\\n```python\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import create\\\\_repo\\n>>> create\\\\_repo(repo\\\\_id=\"test-model\")\\n\\'https://huggingface.co/lysandre/test-model\\'\\n```\\nWhen you check your Hugging Face account, you should now see a `test-model` repository under your namespace.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '6899bd7baf3d2ebb270a0c45', 'page_content': \"## Integrating to the Hub. We're partnering with cool open source ML libraries to provide free model hosting and versioning. You can find the existing integrations [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/libraries). The advantages are:\\n- Free model or dataset hosting for libraries and their users. - Built-in file versioning, even with very large files, thanks to a git-based approach. - Hosted inference API for all models publicly available. - In-browser widgets to play with the uploaded models. - Anyone can upload a new model for your library, they just need to add the corresponding tag for the model to be discoverable. - Fast downloads! We use Cloudfront (a CDN) to geo-replicate downloads so they're blazing fast from anywhere on the globe. - Usage stats and more features to come. If you would like to integrate your library, feel free to open an issue to begin the discussion. We wrote a [step-by-step guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/adding-a-library) with ❤️ showing how to do this integration. ## Contributions (feature requests, bugs, etc.) are super welcome 💙💚💛💜🧡❤️\\nEveryone is welcome to contribute, and we value everybody's contribution. Code is not the only way to help the community. Answering questions, helping others, reaching out and improving the documentations are immensely valuable to the community.

It hosts a wide variety of models, with more than 10,000 publicly available. We'll focus on the models in this chapter, and take a look at the datasets in Chapter 5. The models in the Hub are not limited to 🤗 Transformers or even NLP. There are models from [Flair](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair) and [AllenNLP](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp) for NLP, [Asteroid](https://github.com/asteroid-team/asteroid) and [pyannote](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio) for speech, and [timm](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models) for vision, to name a few. Each of these models is hosted as a Git repository, which allows versioning and reproducibility. Sharing a model on the Hub means opening it up to the community and making it accessible to anyone looking to easily use it, in turn eliminating their need to train a model on their own and simplifying sharing and usage. Additionally, sharing a model on the Hub automatically deploys a hosted Inference API for that model. Anyone in the community is free to test it out directly on the model's page, with custom inputs and appropriate widgets. The best part is that sharing and using any public model on the Hub is completely free! [Paid plans](https://huggingface.co/pricing) also exist if you wish to share models privately. The video below shows how to navigate the Hub.

This technique works by learning and updating the text embeddings (the new embeddings are tied to a special word you must use in the prompt) to match the example images you provide. If you\\'re training on a GPU with limited vRAM, you should try enabling the `gradient\\\\_checkpointing` and `mixed\\\\_precision` parameters in the training command. You can also reduce your memory footprint by using memory-efficient attention with [xFormers](../optimization/xformers). JAX/Flax training is also supported for efficient training on TPUs and GPUs, but it doesn\\'t support gradient checkpointing or xFormers. With the same configuration and setup as PyTorch, the Flax training script should be at least ~70% faster! This guide will explore the [textual\\\\_inversion.py](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/examples/textual\\\\_inversion/textual\\\\_inversion.py) script to help you become more familiar with it, and how you can adapt it for your own use-case. Before running the script, make sure you install the library from source:\\n```bash\\ngit clone https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers\\ncd diffusers\\npip install . ```\\nNavigate to the example folder with the training script and install the required dependencies for the script you\\'re using:\\n\\n```bash\\ncd examples/textual\\\\_inversion\\npip install -r requirements.txt\\n```\\n\\n```bash\\ncd examples/textual\\\\_inversion\\npip install -r requirements\\\\_flax.txt\\n```\\n\\n🤗 Accelerate is a library for helping you train on multiple GPUs/TPUs or with mixed-precision.

This gives you more control over the generated images and allows you to tailor the model towards specific concepts. You can get started quickly with a collection of community created concepts in the [Stable Diffusion Conceptualizer](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sd-concepts-library/stable-diffusion-conceptualizer). This guide will show you how to run inference with textual inversion using a pre-learned concept from the Stable Diffusion Conceptualizer. If you\\'re interested in teaching a model new concepts with textual inversion, take a look at the [Textual Inversion](../training/text\\\\_inversion) training guide. Import the necessary libraries:\\n```py\\nimport torch\\nfrom diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline\\nfrom diffusers.utils import make\\\\_image\\\\_grid\\n```\\n## Stable Diffusion 1 and 2\\nPick a Stable Diffusion checkpoint and a pre-learned concept from the [Stable Diffusion Conceptualizer](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sd-concepts-library/stable-diffusion-conceptualizer):\\n```py\\npretrained\\\\_model\\\\_name\\\\_or\\\\_path = \"runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5\"\\nrepo\\\\_id\\\\_embeds = \"sd-concepts-library/cat-toy\"\\n```\\nNow you can load a pipeline, and pass the pre-learned concept to it:\\n```py\\npipeline = StableDiffusionPipeline.from\\\\_pretrained(\\npretrained\\\\_model\\\\_name\\\\_or\\\\_path, torch\\\\_dtype=torch.float16, use\\\\_safetensors=True\\n).to(\"cuda\")\\npipeline.load\\\\_textual\\\\_inversion(repo\\\\_id\\\\_embeds)\\n```\\nCreate a prompt with the pre-learned concept by using the special placeholder token ``, and choose the number of samples and rows of images you\\'d like to generate:\\n```py\\nprompt = \"a grafitti in a favela wall with a  on it\"\\nnum\\\\_samples\\\\_per\\\\_row = 2\\nnum\\\\_rows = 2\\n```\\nThen run the pipeline (feel free to adjust the parameters like `num\\\\_inference\\\\_steps` and `guidance\\\\_scale` to see how they affect image quality), save the generated images and visualize them with the helper function you created at the beginning:\\n```py\\nall\\\\_images = []\\nfor \\\\_ in range(num\\\\_rows):\\nimages = pipeline(prompt, num\\\\_images\\\\_per\\\\_prompt=num\\\\_samples\\\\_per\\\\_row, num\\\\_inference\\\\_steps=50, guidance\\\\_scale=7.5).images\\nall\\\\_images.extend(images)\\ngrid = make\\\\_image\\\\_grid(all\\\\_images, num\\\\_rows, num\\\\_samples\\\\_per\\\\_row)\\ngrid\\n```\\n\\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/diffusers/textual_inversion_inference.png)\\n\\n## Stable Diffusion XL\\nStable Diffusion XL (SDXL) can also use textual inversion vectors for inference. In contrast to Stable Diffusion 1 and 2, SDXL has two text encoders so you\\'ll need two textual inversion embeddings - one for each text encoder model. Let\\'s download the SDXL textual inversion embeddings and have a closer look at it\\'s structure:\\n```py\\nfrom huggingface\\\\_hub import hf\\\\_hub\\\\_download\\nfrom safetensors.torch import load\\\\_file\\nfile = hf\\\\_hub\\\\_download(\"dn118/unaestheticXL\", filename=\"unaestheticXLv31.safetensors\")\\nstate\\\\_dict = load\\\\_file(file)\\nstate\\\\_dict\\n```\\n```\\n{\\'clip\\\\_g\\': tensor([[ 0.0077, -0.0112, 0.0065, ..., 0.0195, 0.0159, 0.0275],\\n...,\\n[-0.0170, 0.0213, 0.0143, ..., -0.0302, -0.0240, -0.0362]],\\n\\'clip\\\\_l\\': tensor([[ 0.0023, 0.0192, 0.0213, ..., -0.0385, 0.0048, -0.0011],\\n...,\\n[ 0.0475, -0.0508, -0.0145, ..., 0.0070, -0.0089, -0.0163]],\\n```\\nThere are two tensors, `\"clip\\\\_g\"` and `\"clip\\\\_l\"`. `\"clip\\\\_g\"` corresponds to the bigger text encoder in SDXL and refers to\\n`pipe.text\\\\_encoder\\\\_2` and `\"clip\\\\_l\"` refers to `pipe.text\\\\_encoder`.

Let\\'s download the SDXL textual inversion embeddings and have a closer look at it\\'s structure:\\n```py\\nfrom huggingface\\\\_hub import hf\\\\_hub\\\\_download\\nfrom safetensors.torch import load\\\\_file\\nfile = hf\\\\_hub\\\\_download(\"dn118/unaestheticXL\", filename=\"unaestheticXLv31.safetensors\")\\nstate\\\\_dict = load\\\\_file(file)\\nstate\\\\_dict\\n```\\n```\\n{\\'clip\\\\_g\\': tensor([[ 0.0077, -0.0112, 0.0065, ..., 0.0195, 0.0159, 0.0275],\\n...,\\n[-0.0170, 0.0213, 0.0143, ..., -0.0302, -0.0240, -0.0362]],\\n\\'clip\\\\_l\\': tensor([[ 0.0023, 0.0192, 0.0213, ..., -0.0385, 0.0048, -0.0011],\\n...,\\n[ 0.0475, -0.0508, -0.0145, ..., 0.0070, -0.0089, -0.0163]],\\n```\\nThere are two tensors, `\"clip\\\\_g\"` and `\"clip\\\\_l\"`. `\"clip\\\\_g\"` corresponds to the bigger text encoder in SDXL and refers to\\n`pipe.text\\\\_encoder\\\\_2` and `\"clip\\\\_l\"` refers to `pipe.text\\\\_encoder`.

This is where tiling happens and the right multiplier can have a significant speedup. ## Gradient Accumulation\\nThe \\\\*\\\\*gradient accumulation\\\\*\\\\* method aims to calculate gradients in smaller increments instead of computing them for the\\nentire batch at once. This approach involves iteratively calculating gradients in smaller batches by performing forward\\nand backward passes through the model and accumulating the gradients during the process. Once a sufficient number of\\ngradients have been accumulated, the model's optimization step is executed. By employing gradient accumulation, it\\nbecomes possible to increase the \\\\*\\\\*effective batch size\\\\*\\\\* beyond the limitations imposed by the GPU's memory capacity. However, it is important to note that the additional forward and backward passes introduced by gradient accumulation can\\nslow down the training process. You can enable gradient accumulation by adding the `gradient\\\\_accumulation\\\\_steps` argument to [`TrainingArguments`]:\\n```py\\ntraining\\\\_args = TrainingArguments(per\\\\_device\\\\_train\\\\_batch\\\\_size=1, gradient\\\\_accumulation\\\\_steps=4, \\\\*\\\\*default\\\\_args)\\n```\\nIn the above example, your effective batch size becomes 4.\\n\\nIf you are not familiar with this data format, please have a look [at the bits layout]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bfloat16\\\\_floating-point\\\\_format#bfloat16\\\\_floating-point\\\\_format). The key to BF16 format is that it has the same exponent as FP32 and thus doesn't suffer from overflow FP16 suffers from a lot! With FP16, which has a max numerical range of 64k, you can only multiply small numbers. e.g. you can do `250\\\\*250=62500`, but if you were to try `255\\\\*255=65025` you got yourself an overflow, which is what causes the main problems during training. This means your weights have to remain tiny. A technique called loss scaling can help with this problem, but the limited range of FP16 is still an issue when models become very large. BF16 has no such problem, you can easily do `10\\\\_000\\\\*10\\\\_000=100\\\\_000\\\\_000` and it's no problem. Of course, since BF16 and FP16 have the same size of 2 bytes, one doesn't get a free lunch and one pays with really bad precision when using BF16. However, if you remember the training using stochastic gradient descent and its variations is a sort of stumbling walk, so if you don't get the perfect direction immediately it's no problem, you will correct yourself in the next steps. Regardless of whether one uses BF16 or FP16 there is also a copy of weights which is always in FP32 - this is what gets updated by the optimizer. So the 16-bit formats are only used for the computation, the optimizer updates the FP32 weights with full precision and then casts them into the 16-bit format for the next iteration. All PyTorch components have been updated to ensure that they perform any accumulation in FP32, so no loss happening there. One crucial issue is gradient accumulation, and it's one of the main features of pipeline parallelism as the gradients from each microbatch processing get accumulated. It's crucial to implement gradient accumulation in FP32 to keep the training precise, and this is what `BF16Optimizer` does. Besides other improvements we believe that using BF16 mixed precision training turned a potential nightmare into a relatively smooth process which can be observed from the following lm loss graph:\\n![176B-fail](assets/86\\\\_bloom\\\\_megatron\\\\_deepspeed/176b-lm-loss.png)\\n## Fused CUDA Kernels\\nThe GPU performs two things.\\n\\nTried to allocate 40.00 MiB (GPU 0; 23.65 GiB total capacity; 22.27 GiB already allocated; 20.31 MiB free; 22.76 GiB reserved in total by PyTorch) |\\n| DDP | 1 | 2 | NA | OOM Error RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory.

To make it faster and more convenient to write your code, we\\'ve made it easier to \"reload\" your Gradio apps instantly when you are developing in a \\\\*\\\\*Python IDE\\\\*\\\\* (like VS Code, Sublime Text, PyCharm, or so on) or generally running your Python code from the terminal. We\\'ve also developed an analogous \"magic command\" that allows you to re-run cells faster if you use \\\\*\\\\*Jupyter Notebooks\\\\*\\\\* (or any similar environment like Colab). This short Guide will cover both of these methods, so no matter how you write Python, you\\'ll leave knowing how to build Gradio apps faster. ## Python IDE Reload 🔥\\nIf you are building Gradio Blocks using a Python IDE, your file of code (let\\'s name it `run.py`) might look something like this:\\n```python\\nimport gradio as gr\\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\\ngr.Markdown(\"# Greetings from Gradio!\")\\ninp = gr.Textbox(placeholder=\"What is your name?\")\\nout = gr.Textbox()\\ninp.change(fn=lambda x: f\"Welcome, {x}!\",\\ninputs=inp,\\noutputs=out)\\nif \\\\_\\\\_name\\\\_\\\\_ == \"\\\\_\\\\_main\\\\_\\\\_\":\\ndemo.launch()\\n```\\nThe problem is that anytime that you want to make a change to your layout, events, or components, you have to close and rerun your app by writing `python run.py`.\\n\\n通过自动重载实现更快的开发\\n\\\\*\\\\*先决条件\\\\*\\\\*：本指南要求您了解块的知识。请确保[先阅读块指南](https://gradio.app/quickstart/#blocks-more-flexibility-and-control)。\\n本指南介绍了自动重新加载、在 Python IDE 中重新加载以及在 Jupyter Notebooks 中使用 gradio 的方法。\\n## 为什么要使用自动重载？\\n当您构建 Gradio 演示时，特别是使用 Blocks 构建时，您可能会发现反复运行代码以测试更改很麻烦。\\n为了更快速、更便捷地编写代码，我们已经简化了在 \\\\*\\\\*Python IDE\\\\*\\\\*（如 VS Code、Sublime Text、PyCharm 等）中开发或从终端运行 Python 代码时“重新加载”Gradio 应用的方式。我们还开发了一个类似的“魔法命令”，使您可以更快速地重新运行单元格，如果您使用 Jupyter Notebooks（或类似的环境，如 Colab）的话。\\n这个简短的指南将涵盖这两种方法，所以无论您如何编写 Python 代码，您都将知道如何更快地构建 Gradio 应用程序。\\n## Python IDE 重载 🔥\\n如果您使用 Python IDE 构建 Gradio Blocks，那么代码文件（假设命名为 `run.py`）可能如下所示：\\n```python\\nimport gradio as gr\\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\\ngr.Markdown(\"# 来自Gradio的问候！\")\\ninp = gr.Textbox(placeholder=\"您叫什么名字？\")\\nout = gr.Textbox()\\ninp.change(fn=lambda x: f\"欢迎，{x}！\",\\ninputs=inp,\\noutputs=out)\\nif \\\\_\\\\_name\\\\_\\\\_ == \"\\\\_\\\\_main\\\\_\\\\_\":\\ndemo.launch()\\n```\\n问题在于，每当您想要更改布局、事件或组件时，都必须通过编写 `python run.py` 来关闭和重新运行应用程序。\\n而不是这样做，您可以通过更改 1 个单词来以\\\\*\\\\*重新加载模式\\\\*\\\\*运行代码：将 `python` 更改为 `gradio`：\\n在终端中运行 `gradio run.py`。就是这样！\\n现在，您将看到类似于这样的内容：\\n```bash\\nLaunching in \\\\*reload mode\\\\* on: http://127.0.0.1:7860 (Press CTRL+C to quit)\\nWatching...\\n\\nInstead of doing this, you can run your code in \\\\*\\\\*reload mode\\\\*\\\\* by changing 1 word: `python` to `gradio`:\\nIn the terminal, run `gradio run.py`. That\\'s it! Now, you\\'ll see that after you\\'ll see something like this:\\n```bash\\nWatching: \\'/Users/freddy/sources/gradio/gradio\\', \\'/Users/freddy/sources/gradio/demo/\\'\\nRunning on local URL: http://127.0.0.1:7860\\n```\\nThe important part here is the line that says `Watching...` What\\'s happening here is that Gradio will be observing the directory where `run.py` file lives, and if the file changes, it will automatically rerun the file for you. So you can focus on writing your code, and your Gradio demo will refresh automatically 🥳\\n⚠️ Warning: the `gradio` command does not detect the parameters passed to the `launch()` methods because the `launch()` method is never called in reload mode. For example, setting `auth`, or `show\\\\_error` in `launch()` will not be reflected in the app. There is one important thing to keep in mind when using the reload mode: Gradio specifically looks for a Gradio Blocks/Interface demo called `demo` in your code. If you have named your demo something else, you will need to pass in the name of your demo as the 2nd parameter in your code. So if your `run.py` file looked like this:\\n```python\\nimport gradio as gr\\nwith gr.Blocks() as my\\\\_demo:\\ngr.Markdown(\"# Greetings from Gradio!\")\\ninp = gr.Textbox(placeholder=\"What is your name?\")\\nout = gr.Textbox()\\ninp.change(fn=lambda x: f\"Welcome, {x}!\",\\ninputs=inp,\\noutputs=out)\\nif \\\\_\\\\_name\\\\_\\\\_ == \"\\\\_\\\\_main\\\\_\\\\_\":\\nmy\\\\_demo.launch()\\n```\\nThen you would launch it in reload mode like this: `gradio run.py my\\\\_demo`.\\n\\nGradio Demo: blocks\\\\_scroll\\n```\\n!pip install -q gradio\\n```\\n```\\nimport gradio as gr\\ndemo = gr.Blocks()\\nwith demo:\\ninp = gr.Textbox(placeholder=\"Enter text.\")\\nscroll\\\\_btn = gr.Button(\"Scroll\")\\nno\\\\_scroll\\\\_btn = gr.Button(\"No Scroll\")\\nbig\\\\_block = gr.HTML(\"\"\"\"\"\")\\nout = gr.Textbox()\\nscroll\\\\_btn.click(lambda x: x,\\ninputs=inp,\\noutputs=out,\\nscroll\\\\_to\\\\_output=True)\\nno\\\\_scroll\\\\_btn.click(lambda x: x,\\ninputs=inp,\\noutputs=out)\\nif \\\\_\\\\_name\\\\_\\\\_ == \"\\\\_\\\\_main\\\\_\\\\_\":\\ndemo.launch()\\n```', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': 'c62214a2-46a2-43da-b47a-545b7ce820d5', 'tool_call_id': 'call_63TRisrxmbQkXBGrAU5fa5qe', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '6899c2f2666af48523f52222', 'page_content': 'Developing Faster with Auto-Reloading\\n\\\\*\\\\*Prerequisite\\\\*\\\\*: This Guide requires you to know about Blocks.

In this blog post, we\\'ll walk through the steps to install and use the Hugging Face Unity API. ## Installation\\n1. Open your Unity project\\n2. Go to `Window` -> `Package Manager`\\n3. Click `+` and select `Add Package from git URL`\\n4. Enter `https://github.com/huggingface/unity-api.git`\\n5. Once installed, the Unity API wizard should pop up. If not, go to `Window` -> `Hugging Face API Wizard`\\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/124_ml-for-games/packagemanager.gif)\\n6. Enter your API key. Your API key can be created in your [Hugging Face account settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens). 7. Test the API key by clicking `Test API key` in the API Wizard. 8. Optionally, change the model endpoints to change which model to use. The model endpoint for any model that supports the inference API can be found by going to the model on the Hugging Face website, clicking `Deploy` -> `Inference API`, and copying the url from the `API\\\\_URL` field.\\n\\nTo use your own custom model hosted on Hugging Face, change the model endpoint in the API Wizard. ## Usage Tips\\n1. Keep in mind that the API makes calls asynchronously, and returns a response or error via callbacks. 2. Address slow response times or performance issues by changing model endpoints to lower resource models. ## Conclusion\\nThe Hugging Face Unity API offers a simple way to integrate AI models into your Unity projects. We hope you found this tutorial helpful. If you have any questions or would like to get more involved in using Hugging Face for Games, join the [Hugging Face Discord](https://hf.co/join/discord)!\\n\\n9. Configure advanced settings if desired. For up-to-date information, visit the project repository at `https://github.com/huggingface/unity-api`\\n10. To see examples of how to use the API, click `Install Examples`. You can now close the API Wizard. ![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/124_ml-for-games/apiwizard.png)\\nNow that the API is set up, you can make calls from your scripts to the API. Let\\'s look at an example of performing a Sentence Similarity task:\\n```\\nusing HuggingFace.API;\\n/\\\\* other code \\\\*/\\n// Make a call to the API\\nvoid Query() {\\nstring inputText = \"I\\'m on my way to the forest.\";\\nstring[] candidates = {\\n\"The player is going to the city\",\\n\"The player is going to the wilderness\",\\n\"The player is wandering aimlessly\"\\n};\\nHuggingFaceAPI.SentenceSimilarity(inputText, OnSuccess, OnError, candidates);\\n}\\n// If successful, handle the result\\nvoid OnSuccess(float[] result) {\\nforeach(float value in result) {\\nDebug.Log(value);\\n}\\n}\\n// Otherwise, handle the error\\nvoid OnError(string error) {\\nDebug.LogError(error);\\n}\\n/\\\\* other code \\\\*/\\n```\\n## Supported Tasks and Custom Models\\nThe Hugging Face Unity API also currently supports the following tasks:\\n- [Conversation](https://huggingface.co/tasks/conversational)\\n- [Text Generation](https://huggingface.co/tasks/text-generation)\\n- [Text to Image](https://huggingface.co/tasks/text-to-image)\\n- [Text Classification](https://huggingface.co/tasks/text-classification)\\n- [Question Answering](https://huggingface.co/tasks/question-answering)\\n- [Translation](https://huggingface.co/tasks/translation)\\n- [Summarization](https://huggingface.co/tasks/summarization)\\n- [Speech Recognition](https://huggingface.co/tasks/automatic-speech-recognition)\\nUse the corresponding methods provided by the `HuggingFaceAPI` class to perform these tasks.\\n\\np align=\"center\">\\n\\n![huggingface_hub library logo](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/raw/main/huggingface_hub.svg)\\n\\n*The official Python client for the Huggingface Hub.*\\n\\n[![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/website/http/huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/index.svg?down_color=red&down_message=offline&up_message=online&label=doc)](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/index)\\n[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/huggingface/huggingface_hub.svg)](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/releases)\\n[![PyPi version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/huggingface_hub.svg)](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub)\\n[![downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/huggingface_hub/month)](https://pypi.org/project/huggingface-hub)\\n[![Code coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/huggingface/huggingface_hub/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=RXP95LE2XL)](https://codecov.io/gh/huggingface/huggingface_hub)\\n\\n#### **English** | [Deutsch](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/blob/main/README_de.md) | [हिंदी](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/blob/main/README_hi.md) | [한국어](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/blob/main/README_ko.md) | [中文（简体）](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/blob/main/README_cn.md)\\n\\n---\\n\\\\*\\\\*Documentation\\\\*\\\\*: <https://hf.co/docs/huggingface_hub>\\n\\\\*\\\\*Source Code\\\\*\\\\*: <https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub>\\n---\\n## Welcome to the huggingface\\\\_hub library\\nThe `huggingface\\\\_hub` library allows you to interact with the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/), a platform democratizing open-source Machine Learning for creators and collaborators.', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': '0d41ed8a-abfc-4c46-a1d9-83d7133a1fc1', 'tool_call_id': 'call_ZElW7zjvirGlUtudJSwZEjir', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '6899b8a8af3d2ebb270a069c', 'page_content': '--\\ntitle: \"How to Install and Use the Hugging Face Unity API\"\\nthumbnail: /blog/assets/124\\\\_ml-for-games/unity-api-thumbnail.png\\nauthors:\\n- user: dylanebert\\n---\\n# How to Install and Use the Hugging Face Unity API\\nThe [Hugging Face Unity API](https://github.com/huggingface/unity-api) is an easy-to-use integration of the [Hugging Face Inference API](https://huggingface.co/inference-api), allowing developers to access and use Hugging Face AI models in their Unity projects.

The abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*We show for the first time that learning powerful representations from speech audio alone followed by fine-tuning on\\ntranscribed speech can outperform the best semi-supervised methods while being conceptually simpler. wav2vec 2.0 masks\\nthe speech input in the latent space and solves a contrastive task defined over a quantization of the latent\\nrepresentations which are jointly learned. Experiments using all labeled data of Librispeech achieve 1.8/3.3 WER on the\\nclean/other test sets. When lowering the amount of labeled data to one hour, wav2vec 2.0 outperforms the previous state\\nof the art on the 100 hour subset while using 100 times less labeled data. Using just ten minutes of labeled data and\\npre-training on 53k hours of unlabeled data still achieves 4.8/8.2 WER. This demonstrates the feasibility of speech\\nrecognition with limited amounts of labeled data.\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [patrickvonplaten](https://huggingface.co/patrickvonplaten). ## Usage tips\\n- Wav2Vec2 is a speech model that accepts a float array corresponding to the raw waveform of the speech signal. - Wav2Vec2 model was trained using connectionist temporal classification (CTC) so the model output has to be decoded\\nusing [`Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer`]. ## Resources\\nA list of official Hugging Face and community (indicated by 🌎) resources to help you get started with Wav2Vec2.\\n\\nNote that many training parameters can be set in the model configuration including\\nthe configuration about the masking distribution (`mask\\\\_time\\\\_length`, `mask\\\\_time\\\\_prob`),\\ndropout (`attention\\\\_dropout`, ...), the trade-off between the contrastive loss and\\nthe diversity loss, etc... Mostly likely you will need to change these parameters depending on your use case. Again, we highly recommend to read the [official paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11477)\\nto better understand which parameters can be set for pretraining. For this example, we will be using a `\"base\"`-sized model of Wav2Vec2 with robust\\nlayer norm and keep most of the default settings. ```python\\nmodel\\\\_dir=\"./wav2vec2-base-robust\"\\nfrom transformers import Wav2Vec2Config\\nconfig = Wav2Vec2Config.from\\\\_pretrained(\\n\"facebook/wav2vec2-base\",\\nmask\\\\_time\\\\_length=10,\\nmask\\\\_time\\\\_prob=0.05,\\ndiversity\\\\_loss\\\\_weight=0.1,\\nnum\\\\_negatives=100,\\ndo\\\\_stable\\\\_layer\\\\_norm=True,\\nfeat\\\\_extract\\\\_norm=\"layer\",\\n)\\nconfig.save\\\\_pretrained(model\\\\_dir)\\n```\\n### Create a feature extractor configuration\\nBefore we can start the training, we need to define\\na feature extractor that takes care of normalization, etc...

We will make use of 🤗\\\\\\'s\\n[Trainer](https://huggingface.co/transformers/master/main\\\\_classes/trainer.html?highlight=trainer)\\nfor which we essentially need to do the following:\\n- Define a data collator. In contrast to most NLP models, Wav2Vec2 has\\na much larger input length than output length. \\\\*E.g.\\\\*, a sample of\\ninput length 50000 has an output length of no more than 100. Given\\nthe large input sizes, it is much more efficient to pad the training\\nbatches dynamically meaning that all training samples should only be\\npadded to the longest sample in their batch and not the overall\\nlongest sample. Therefore, fine-tuning Wav2Vec2 requires a special\\npadding data collator, which we will define below\\n- Evaluation metric.\\n\\nWav2Vec2 Contrastive Loss PreTraining examples\\nThe following example showcases how to pretrain a wav2vec2 model using the JAX/Flax backend. Pretraining Wav2Vec2 is rather complex, so it is highly recommended to read the\\n[official paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11477). JAX/Flax allows you to trace pure functions and compile them into efficient, fused accelerator code on both GPU and TPU. Models written in JAX/Flax are \\\\*\\\\*immutable\\\\*\\\\* and updated in a purely functional\\nway which enables simple and efficient model parallelism. `run\\\\_wav2vec2\\\\_pretrain\\\\_flax.py` is a lightweight example of how to download and preprocess a dataset from the 🤗 Datasets library or use your own files (jsonlines or csv), then pretrain the wav2vec2 architectures above on it. For custom datasets in `jsonlines` format please see: [the Datasets documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/loading\\\\_datasets#json-files) and you also will find examples of these below. Let\\'s start by creating a model repository to save the trained model and logs. Here we call the model `\"wav2vec2-base-robust\"`, but you can change the model name as you like. You can do this either directly on [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/new) (assuming that\\nyou are logged in) or via the command line:\\n```\\nhuggingface-cli repo create wav2vec2-base-robust\\n```\\nNext we clone the model repository to add the tokenizer and model files. ```\\ngit clone https://huggingface.co//wav2vec2-base-robust\\n```\\nTo ensure that all tensorboard traces will be uploaded correctly, we need to\\ntrack them. You can run the following command inside your model repo to do so. ```\\ncd wav2vec2-base-robust\\ngit lfs track \"\\\\*tfevents\\\\*\"\\n```\\nGreat, we have set up our model repository. During training, we will automatically\\npush the training logs and model weights to the repo.

In this video, we will look at what actually happens when we use the pipeline function of the Transformers library. More specifically, we will look at the sentiment analysis pipeline, and how it went from the two following sentences to the positive labels with their respective scores. As we have seen in the pipeline presentation, there are three stages in the pipeline. First, we convert the raw texts to numbers the model can make sense of, using a tokenizer. Then, those numbers go through the model, which outputs logits. Finally, the post-processing steps transforms those logits into labels and scores. Let\\'s look in detail at those three steps, and how to replicate them using the Transformers library, beginning with the first stage, tokenization. The tokenization process has several steps. First, the text is split into small chunks called tokens. They can be words, parts of words or punctuation symbols. Then the tokenizer will had some special tokens (if the model expect them). Here the model uses expects a CLS token at the beginning and a SEP token at the end of the sentence to classify. Lastly, the tokenizer matches each token to its unique ID in the vocabulary of the pretrained model. To load such a tokenizer, the Transformers library provides the AutoTokenizer API.

Here, the checkpoint used by default for the sentiment analysis pipeline is distilbert base uncased finetuned sst2 english.

Since those two sentences are not of the same size, we will need to pad the shortest one to be able to build an array. This is done by the tokenizer with the option padding=True. With truncation=True, we ensure that any sentence longer than the maximum the model can handle is truncated. Lastly, the return\\\\_tensors option tells the tokenizer to return a TensorFlow tensor.\\n\\nhat happens inside the pipeline function?

Smaller checkpoints present interesting results too. \\\\*\\\\*Gaudi2 is 2.89x faster than A100 for BLOOMZ-7B!\\\\*\\\\* It is also interesting to note that it manages to benefit from model parallelism whereas A100 is faster on a single device. We also ran these models on first-gen Gaudi. While it is slower than Gaudi2, it is interesting from a price perspective as a DL1 instance on AWS costs approximately 13\\\\$ per hour. Latency for BLOOMZ-7B on first-gen Gaudi is 2.387 seconds. Thus, \\\\*\\\\*first-gen Gaudi offers for the 7-billion checkpoint a better price-performance ratio than A100\\\\*\\\\* which costs more than 30\\\\$ per hour! We expect the Habana team will optimize the performance of these models in the upcoming SynapseAI releases. For example, in our last benchmark, we saw that [Gaudi2 performs Stable Diffusion inference 2.2x faster than A100](https://huggingface.co/blog/habana-gaudi-2-benchmark#generating-images-from-text-with-stable-diffusion) and this has since been improved further to 2.37x with the latest optimizations provided by Habana. We will update these numbers as new versions of SynapseAI are released and integrated within Optimum Habana.\\n\\nThe Gaudi runs were performed in \\\\*bfloat16\\\\* precision and the A100 runs in \\\\*fp16\\\\* precision (more information [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/fp16)). All runs were \\\\*single-device\\\\* runs. ### Fine-tuning T5-3B\\nWith 96 GB of memory per device, Gaudi2 enables running much bigger models. For instance, we managed to fine-tune T5-3B (containing 3 billion parameters) with gradient checkpointing being the only applied memory optimization. This is not possible on first-gen Gaudi. [Here](https://huggingface.co/regisss/t5-3b-summarization-gaudi-2/tensorboard?scroll=1#scalars) are the logs of this run where the model was fine-tuned on the CNN DailyMail dataset for text summarization using [this script](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana/tree/main/examples/summarization). The results we achieved are presented in the table below. \\\\*\\\\*Gaudi2 is x2.44 faster than A100 80GB.\\\\*\\\\* We observe that we cannot fit a batch size larger than 1 on Gaudi2 here. This is due to the memory space taken by the graph where operations are accumulated during the first iteration of the run. Habana is working on optimizing the memory footprint in future releases of SynapseAI. We are looking forward to expanding this benchmark using newer versions of Habana\\'s SDK and also using [DeepSpeed](https://www.deepspeed.ai/) to see if the same trend holds. | | First-gen Gaudi | Gaudi2 (BS=1) | A100 (BS=16) |\\n|:-:|:-------:|:--------------:|:------------:|\\n| Throughput (samples/s) | N/A | 19.7 | 8.07 |\\n| Speedup | / | x2.44 | x1.0 |\\n\\\\*BS\\\\* is the batch size per device.\\n\\n--\\ntitle: \"Faster Training and Inference: Habana Gaudi®2 vs Nvidia A100 80GB\"\\nthumbnail: /blog/assets/habana-gaudi-2-benchmark/thumbnail.png\\nauthors:\\n- user: regisss\\n---\\n# Faster Training and Inference: Habana Gaudi®-2 vs Nvidia A100 80GB\\nIn this article, you will learn how to use [Habana® Gaudi®2](https://habana.ai/training/gaudi2/) to accelerate model training and inference, and train bigger models with 🤗 [Optimum Habana](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/habana/index). Then, we present several benchmarks including BERT pre-training, Stable Diffusion inference and T5-3B fine-tuning, to assess the performance differences between first generation Gaudi, Gaudi2 and Nvidia A100 80GB. Spoiler alert - Gaudi2 is about twice faster than Nvidia A100 80GB for both training and inference! [Gaudi2](https://habana.ai/training/gaudi2/) is the second generation AI hardware accelerator designed by Habana Labs. A single server contains 8 accelerator devices with 96GB of memory each (versus 32GB on first generation Gaudi and 80GB on A100 80GB). The Habana SDK, [SynapseAI](https://developer.habana.ai/), is common to both first-gen Gaudi and Gaudi2. That means that 🤗 Optimum Habana, which offers a very user-friendly interface between the 🤗 Transformers and 🤗 Diffusers libraries and SynapseAI, \\\\*\\\\*works the exact same way on Gaudi2 as on first-gen Gaudi!\\\\*\\\\*\\nSo if you already have ready-to-use training or inference workflows for first-gen Gaudi, we encourage you to try them on Gaudi2, as they will work without any single change. ## How to Get Access to Gaudi2? One of the easy, cost-efficient ways that Intel and Habana have made Gaudi2 available is on the Intel Developer Cloud. To start using Gaudi2 there, you should follow the following steps:\\n1.\\n\\n--\\ntitle: \"Fast Inference on Large Language Models: BLOOMZ on Habana Gaudi2 Accelerator\"\\nthumbnail: /blog/assets/habana-gaudi-2-bloom/thumbnail.png\\nauthors:\\n- user: regisss\\n---\\n# Fast Inference on Large Language Models: BLOOMZ on Habana Gaudi2 Accelerator\\nThis article will show you how to easily deploy large language models with hundreds of billions of parameters like BLOOM on [Habana® Gaudi®2](https://habana.ai/training/gaudi2/) using 🤗 [Optimum Habana](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/habana/index), which is the bridge between Gaudi2 and the 🤗 Transformers library. As demonstrated in the benchmark presented in this post, this will enable you to \\\\*\\\\*run inference faster than with any GPU currently available on the market\\\\*\\\\*. As models get bigger and bigger, deploying them into production to run inference has become increasingly challenging. Both hardware and software have seen a lot of innovations to address these challenges, so let\\'s dive in to see how to efficiently overcome them! ## BLOOMZ\\n[BLOOM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05100) is a 176-billion-parameter autoregressive model that was trained to complete sequences of text. It can handle 46 different languages and 13 programming languages. Designed and trained as part of the [BigScience](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/) initiative, BLOOM is an open-science project that involved a large number of researchers and engineers all over the world. More recently, another model with the exact same architecture was released: [BLOOMZ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01786), which is a fine-tuned version of BLOOM on several tasks leading to better generalization and zero-shot[^1] capabilities. Such large models raise new challenges in terms of memory and speed for both [training](https://huggingface.co/blog/bloom-megatron-deepspeed) and [inference](https://huggingface.co/blog/bloom-inference-optimization). Even in 16-bit precision, one instance requires 352 GB to fit! You will probably struggle to find any device with so much memory at the moment, but state-of-the-art hardware like Habana Gaudi2 does make it possible to perform inference on BLOOM and BLOOMZ models with low latencies. ## Habana Gaudi2\\n[Gaudi2](https://habana.ai/training/gaudi2/) is the second-generation AI hardware accelerator designed by Habana Labs. A single server contains 8 accelerator devices (called Habana Processing Units, or HPUs) with 96GB of memory each, which provides room to make very large models fit in. However, hosting the model is not very interesting if the computation is slow. Fortunately, Gaudi2 shines on that aspect: it differs from GPUs in that its architecture enables the accelerator to perform General Matrix Multiplication (GeMM) and other operations in parallel, which speeds up deep learning workflows. These features make Gaudi2 a great candidate for LLM training and inference. Habana\\'s SDK, SynapseAI™, supports PyTorch and DeepSpeed for accelerating LLM training and inference. The [SynapseAI graph compiler](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/Gaudi\\\\_Overview/SynapseAI\\\\_Software\\\\_Suite.html#graph-compiler-and-runtime) will optimize the execution of the operations accumulated in the graph (e.g. operator fusion, data layout management, parallelization, pipelining and memory management, and graph-level optimizations). Moreover, support for [HPU graphs](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/PyTorch/Inference\\\\_on\\\\_PyTorch/Inference\\\\_Using\\\\_HPU\\\\_Graphs.html) and [DeepSpeed-inference](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/PyTorch/DeepSpeed/Inference\\\\_Using\\\\_DeepSpeed.html) have just recently been introduced in SynapseAI, and these are well-suited for latency-sensitive applications as shown in our benchmark below. All these features are integrated into the 🤗 [Optimum Habana](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana) library so that deploying your model on Gaudi is very simple. Check out the quick-start page [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/habana/quickstart). If you would like to get access to Gaudi2, go to the [Intel Developer Cloud](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/secure/developer/devcloud/cloud-launchpad.html) and follow [this guide](https://huggingface.co/blog/habana-gaudi-2-benchmark#how-to-get-access-to-gaudi2). ## Benchmarks\\nIn this section, we are going to provide an early benchmark of BLOOMZ on Gaudi2, first-generation Gaudi and Nvidia A100 80GB.', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': 'b862911a-7311-4b48-bc95-759f028e46a0', 'tool_call_id': 'call_3pUYEx152oV5lGCj0L84ZNae', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689ab2663e684812d15f677e', 'page_content': 'Note that while [CUDA graphs](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/cuda-graphs/) are not currently compatible with model parallelism in DeepSpeed (DeepSpeed v0.8.2, see [here](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed/blob/v0.8.2/deepspeed/inference/engine.py#L158)), HPU graphs are supported in Habana\\'s DeepSpeed fork. All benchmarks are doing [greedy generation](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate#greedy-search) of 100 token outputs. The input prompt is:\\n> \"DeepSpeed is a machine learning framework\"\\nwhich consists of 7 tokens with BLOOM\\'s tokenizer. The results for inference latency are displayed in the table below (the unit is \\\\*seconds\\\\*). | Model | Number of devices | Gaudi2 latency (seconds) | A100-80GB latency (seconds) | First-gen Gaudi latency (seconds) |\\n|:-----------:|:-----------------:|:-------------------------:|:-----------------:|:----------------------------------:|\\n| BLOOMZ | 8 | 3.103 | 4.402 | / |\\n| BLOOMZ-7B | 8 | 0.734 | 2.417 | 3.321 |\\n| BLOOMZ-7B | 1 | 0.772 | 2.119 | 2.387 |\\n\\\\*Update: the numbers above were updated with the releases of Optimum Habana 1.6 and SynapseAI 1.10, leading to a\\\\* x\\\\*1.42 speedup on BLOOMZ with Gaudi2 compared to A100.\\\\*\\nThe Habana team recently introduced support for DeepSpeed-inference in SynapseAI 1.8, and thereby quickly enabled inference for 100+ billion parameter models. \\\\*\\\\*For the 176-billion-parameter checkpoint, Gaudi2 is 1.42x faster than A100 80GB\\\\*\\\\*. Smaller checkpoints present interesting results too. \\\\*\\\\*Gaudi2 is 2.89x faster than A100 for BLOOMZ-7B!\\\\*\\\\* It is also interesting to note that it manages to benefit from model parallelism whereas A100 is faster on a single device. We also ran these models on first-gen Gaudi. While it is slower than Gaudi2, it is interesting from a price perspective as a DL1 instance on AWS costs approximately 13\\\\$ per hour. Latency for BLOOMZ-7B on first-gen Gaudi is 2.387 seconds. Thus, \\\\*\\\\*first-gen Gaudi offers for the 7-billion checkpoint a better price-performance ratio than A100\\\\*\\\\* which costs more than 30\\\\$ per hour! We expect the Habana team will optimize the performance of these models in the upcoming SynapseAI releases. For example, in our last benchmark, we saw that [Gaudi2 performs Stable Diffusion inference 2.2x faster than A100](https://huggingface.co/blog/habana-gaudi-2-benchmark#generating-images-from-text-with-stable-diffusion) and this has since been improved further to 2.37x with the latest optimizations provided by Habana. We will update these numbers as new versions of SynapseAI are released and integrated within Optimum Habana.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689ab9a93e684812d15f7016', 'page_content': \"The Gaudi runs were performed in \\\\*bfloat16\\\\* precision and the A100 runs in \\\\*fp16\\\\* precision (more information [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/fp16)). All runs were \\\\*single-device\\\\* runs. ### Fine-tuning T5-3B\\nWith 96 GB of memory per device, Gaudi2 enables running much bigger models. For instance, we managed to fine-tune T5-3B (containing 3 billion parameters) with gradient checkpointing being the only applied memory optimization. This is not possible on first-gen Gaudi. [Here](https://huggingface.co/regisss/t5-3b-summarization-gaudi-2/tensorboard?scroll=1#scalars) are the logs of this run where the model was fine-tuned on the CNN DailyMail dataset for text summarization using [this script](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana/tree/main/examples/summarization).

This is due to the memory space taken by the graph where operations are accumulated during the first iteration of the run. Habana is working on optimizing the memory footprint in future releases of SynapseAI. We are looking forward to expanding this benchmark using newer versions of Habana's SDK and also using [DeepSpeed](https://www.deepspeed.ai/) to see if the same trend holds. | | First-gen Gaudi | Gaudi2 (BS=1) | A100 (BS=16) |\\n|:-:|:-------:|:--------------:|:------------:|\\n| Throughput (samples/s) | N/A | 19.7 | 8.07 |\\n| Speedup | / | x2.44 | x1.0 |\\n\\\\*BS\\\\* is the batch size per device.\", 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689ab9a93e684812d15f7012', 'page_content': '--\\ntitle: \"Faster Training and Inference: Habana Gaudi®2 vs Nvidia A100 80GB\"\\nthumbnail: /blog/assets/habana-gaudi-2-benchmark/thumbnail.png\\nauthors:\\n- user: regisss\\n---\\n# Faster Training and Inference: Habana Gaudi®-2 vs Nvidia A100 80GB\\nIn this article, you will learn how to use [Habana® Gaudi®2](https://habana.ai/training/gaudi2/) to accelerate model training and inference, and train bigger models with 🤗 [Optimum Habana](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/habana/index). Then, we present several benchmarks including BERT pre-training, Stable Diffusion inference and T5-3B fine-tuning, to assess the performance differences between first generation Gaudi, Gaudi2 and Nvidia A100 80GB. Spoiler alert - Gaudi2 is about twice faster than Nvidia A100 80GB for both training and inference! [Gaudi2](https://habana.ai/training/gaudi2/) is the second generation AI hardware accelerator designed by Habana Labs. A single server contains 8 accelerator devices with 96GB of memory each (versus 32GB on first generation Gaudi and 80GB on A100 80GB). The Habana SDK, [SynapseAI](https://developer.habana.ai/), is common to both first-gen Gaudi and Gaudi2. That means that 🤗 Optimum Habana, which offers a very user-friendly interface between the 🤗 Transformers and 🤗 Diffusers libraries and SynapseAI, \\\\*\\\\*works the exact same way on Gaudi2 as on first-gen Gaudi!\\\\*\\\\*\\nSo if you already have ready-to-use training or inference workflows for first-gen Gaudi, we encourage you to try them on Gaudi2, as they will work without any single change. ## How to Get Access to Gaudi2? One of the easy, cost-efficient ways that Intel and Habana have made Gaudi2 available is on the Intel Developer Cloud. To start using Gaudi2 there, you should follow the following steps:\\n1.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689ab2663e684812d15f677c', 'page_content': '--\\ntitle: \"Fast Inference on Large Language Models: BLOOMZ on Habana Gaudi2 Accelerator\"\\nthumbnail: /blog/assets/habana-gaudi-2-bloom/thumbnail.png\\nauthors:\\n- user: regisss\\n---\\n# Fast Inference on Large Language Models: BLOOMZ on Habana Gaudi2 Accelerator\\nThis article will show you how to easily deploy large language models with hundreds of billions of parameters like BLOOM on [Habana® Gaudi®2](https://habana.ai/training/gaudi2/) using 🤗 [Optimum Habana](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/habana/index), which is the bridge between Gaudi2 and the 🤗 Transformers library. As demonstrated in the benchmark presented in this post, this will enable you to \\\\*\\\\*run inference faster than with any GPU currently available on the market\\\\*\\\\*.

However, how would you then get this script to run on say two GPUs or on multiple machines if these resources are available, which could improve training speed through \\\\*distributed\\\\* training? Just doing `python myscript.py` will only ever run the script using a single GPU. This is where `torch.distributed` comes into play\\n## PyTorch Distributed Data Parallelism\\nAs the name implies, `torch.distributed` is meant to work on \\\\*distributed\\\\* setups. This can include multi-node, where you have a number of machines each with a single GPU, or multi-gpu where a single system has multiple GPUs, or some combination of both. To convert our above code to work within a distributed setup, a few setup configurations must first be defined, detailed in the [Getting Started with DDP Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp\\\\_tutorial.html)\\nFirst a `setup` and a `cleanup` function must be declared. This will open up a processing group that all of the compute processes can communicate through\\n> Note: for this section of the tutorial it should be assumed these are sent in python script files. Later on a launcher using Accelerate will be discussed that removes this necessity\\n```python\\nimport os\\nimport torch.distributed as dist\\ndef setup(rank, world\\\\_size):\\n\"Sets up the process group and configuration for PyTorch Distributed Data Parallelism\"\\nos.environ[\"MASTER\\\\_ADDR\"] = \\'localhost\\'\\nos.environ[\"MASTER\\\\_PORT\"] = \"12355\"\\n# Initialize the process group\\ndist.init\\\\_process\\\\_group(\"gloo\", rank=rank, world\\\\_size=world\\\\_size)\\ndef cleanup():\\n\"Cleans up the distributed environment\"\\ndist.destroy\\\\_process\\\\_group()\\n```\\nThe last piece of the puzzle is \\\\*how do I send my data and model to another GPU?\\\\*\\nThis is where the `DistributedDataParallel` module comes into play. It will copy your model onto each GPU, and when `loss.backward()` is called the backpropagation is performed and the resulting gradients across all these copies of the model will be averaged/reduced. This ensures each device has the same weights post the optimizer step. Below is an example of our training setup, refactored as a function, with this capability:\\n> Note: Here rank is the overall rank of the current GPU compared to all the other GPUs available, meaning they have a rank of `0 -> n-1`\\n```python\\nfrom torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel as DDP\\ndef train(model, rank, world\\\\_size):\\nsetup(rank, world\\\\_size)\\nmodel = model.to(rank)\\nddp\\\\_model = DDP(model, device\\\\_ids=[rank])\\noptimizer = optim.AdamW(ddp\\\\_model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)\\n# Train for one epoch\\nmodel.train()\\nfor batch\\\\_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(train\\\\_loader):\\ndata, target = data.to(device), target.to(device)\\noutput = model(data)\\nloss = F.nll\\\\_loss(output, target)\\nloss.backward()\\noptimizer.step()\\noptimizer.zero\\\\_grad()\\ncleanup()\\n```\\nThe optimizer needs to be declared based on the model \\\\*on the specific device\\\\* (so `ddp\\\\_model` and not `model`) for all of the gradients to properly be calculated. Lastly, to run the script PyTorch has a convenient `torchrun` command line module that can help. Just pass in the number of nodes it should use as well as the script to run and you are set:\\n```bash\\ntorchrun --nproc\\\\_per\\\\_node=2 --nnodes=1 example\\\\_script.py\\n```\\nThe above will run the training script on two GPUs that live on a single machine and this is the barebones for performing only distributed training with PyTorch.\\n\\n## PyTorch Distributed\\nPyTorch supports [`DistributedDataParallel`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel.html) which enables data parallelism. To start, create a Python file and import `torch.distributed` and `torch.multiprocessing` to set up the distributed process group and to spawn the processes for inference on each GPU. You should also initialize a [`DiffusionPipeline`]:\\n```py\\nimport torch\\nimport torch.distributed as dist\\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\\nfrom diffusers import DiffusionPipeline\\nsd = DiffusionPipeline.from\\\\_pretrained(\\n\"runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5\", torch\\\\_dtype=torch.float16, use\\\\_safetensors=True\\n)\\n```\\nYou\\'ll want to create a function to run inference; [`init\\\\_process\\\\_group`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html?highlight=init\\\\_process\\\\_group#torch.distributed.init\\\\_process\\\\_group) handles creating a distributed environment with the type of backend to use, the `rank` of the current process, and the `world\\\\_size` or the number of processes participating. If you\\'re running inference in parallel over 2 GPUs, then the `world\\\\_size` is 2. Move the [`DiffusionPipeline`] to `rank` and use `get\\\\_rank` to assign a GPU to each process, where each process handles a different prompt:\\n```py\\ndef run\\\\_inference(rank, world\\\\_size):\\ndist.init\\\\_process\\\\_group(\"nccl\", rank=rank, world\\\\_size=world\\\\_size)\\nsd.to(rank)\\nif torch.distributed.get\\\\_rank() == 0:\\nprompt = \"a dog\"\\nelif torch.distributed.get\\\\_rank() == 1:\\nprompt = \"a cat\"\\nimage = sd(prompt).images[0]\\nimage.save(f\"./{\\'\\\\_\\'.join(prompt)}.png\")\\n```\\nTo run the distributed inference, call [`mp.spawn`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/multiprocessing.html#torch.multiprocessing.spawn) to run the `run\\\\_inference` function on the number of GPUs defined in `world\\\\_size`:\\n```py\\ndef main():\\nworld\\\\_size = 2\\nmp.spawn(run\\\\_inference, args=(world\\\\_size,), nprocs=world\\\\_size, join=True)\\nif \\\\_\\\\_name\\\\_\\\\_ == \"\\\\_\\\\_main\\\\_\\\\_\":\\nmain()\\n```\\nOnce you\\'ve completed the inference script, use the `--nproc\\\\_per\\\\_node` argument to specify the number of GPUs to use and call `torchrun` to run the script:\\n```bash\\ntorchrun run\\\\_distributed.py --nproc\\\\_per\\\\_node=2\\n```\\n\\nJust add the flag `--fp16` to your command launching one of the scripts mentioned above! Using mixed precision training usually results in 2x-speedup for training with the same final results (as shown in\\n[this table](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/text-classification#mixed-precision-training)\\nfor text classification). ## Running on TPUs\\nWhen using Tensorflow, TPUs are supported out of the box as a `tf.distribute.Strategy`. When using PyTorch, we support TPUs thanks to `pytorch/xla`. For more context and information on how to setup your TPU environment refer to Google\\'s documentation and to the\\nvery detailed [pytorch/xla README](https://github.com/pytorch/xla/blob/master/README.md). In this repo, we provide a very simple launcher script named\\n[xla\\\\_spawn.py](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/pytorch/xla\\\\_spawn.py) that lets you run our\\nexample scripts on multiple TPU cores without any boilerplate. Just pass a `--num\\\\_cores` flag to this script, then your\\nregular training script with its arguments (this is similar to the `torch.distributed.launch` helper for\\n`torch.distributed`):\\n```bash\\npython xla\\\\_spawn.py --num\\\\_cores num\\\\_tpu\\\\_you\\\\_have \\\\\\npath\\\\_to\\\\_script.py \\\\\\n--all\\\\_arguments\\\\_of\\\\_the\\\\_script\\n```\\nAs an example, here is how you would fine-tune the BERT large model (with whole word masking) on the text\\nclassification MNLI task using the `run\\\\_glue` script, with 8 TPUs (from this folder):\\n```bash\\npython xla\\\\_spawn.py --num\\\\_cores 8 \\\\\\ntext-classification/run\\\\_glue.py \\\\\\n--model\\\\_name\\\\_or\\\\_path bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking \\\\\\n--task\\\\_name mnli \\\\\\n--do\\\\_train \\\\\\n--do\\\\_eval \\\\\\n--max\\\\_seq\\\\_length 128 \\\\\\n--per\\\\_device\\\\_train\\\\_batch\\\\_size 8 \\\\\\n--learning\\\\_rate 2e-5 \\\\\\n--num\\\\_train\\\\_epochs 3.0 \\\\\\n--output\\\\_dir /tmp/mnli\\\\_output/\\n```\\n## Using Accelerate\\nMost PyTorch example scripts have a version using the [🤗 Accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate) library\\nthat exposes the training loop so it\\'s easy for you to customize or tweak them to your needs.\\n\\n2. All sequences should be padded to be of equal length to avoid extremely slow training. (`finetune\\\\_trainer.py` does this automatically when running on TPU.)\\nWe provide a very simple launcher script named `xla\\\\_spawn.py` that lets you run our example scripts on multiple TPU cores without any boilerplate. Just pass a `--num\\\\_cores` flag to this script, then your regular training script with its arguments (this is similar to the `torch.distributed.launch` helper for `torch.distributed`). `builtin\\\\_trainer/finetune\\\\_tpu.sh` script provides minimal arguments needed for TPU training.

If \\'translation\\' is in your task name, the computed metric will be BLEU. Otherwise, ROUGE will be used. For t5, you need to specify --task translation\\\\_{src}\\\\_to\\\\_{tgt} as follows:\\n```bash\\nexport DATA\\\\_DIR=wmt\\\\_en\\\\_ro\\n./run\\\\_eval.py t5-base \\\\\\n$DATA\\\\_DIR/val.source t5\\\\_val\\\\_generations.txt \\\\\\n--reference\\\\_path $DATA\\\\_DIR/val.target \\\\\\n--score\\\\_path enro\\\\_bleu.json \\\\\\n--task translation\\\\_en\\\\_to\\\\_ro \\\\\\n--n\\\\_obs 100 \\\\\\n--device cuda \\\\\\n--fp16 \\\\\\n--bs 32\\n```\\nThis command works for MBART, although the BLEU score is suspiciously low. ```bash\\nexport DATA\\\\_DIR=wmt\\\\_en\\\\_ro\\n./run\\\\_eval.py facebook/mbart-large-en-ro $DATA\\\\_DIR/val.source mbart\\\\_val\\\\_generations.txt \\\\\\n--reference\\\\_path $DATA\\\\_DIR/val.target \\\\\\n--score\\\\_path enro\\\\_bleu.json \\\\\\n--task translation \\\\\\n--n\\\\_obs 100 \\\\\\n--device cuda \\\\\\n--fp16 \\\\\\n--bs 32\\n```\\nSummarization (xsum will be very similar):\\n```bash\\nexport DATA\\\\_DIR=cnn\\\\_dm\\n./run\\\\_eval.py sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6 $DATA\\\\_DIR/val.source dbart\\\\_val\\\\_generations.txt \\\\\\n--reference\\\\_path $DATA\\\\_DIR/val.target \\\\\\n--score\\\\_path cnn\\\\_rouge.json \\\\\\n--task summarization \\\\\\n--n\\\\_obs 100 \\\\\\nth 56 \\\\\\n--fp16 \\\\\\n--bs 32\\n```\\n### Multi-GPU Evaluation\\nhere is a command to run xsum evaluation on 8 GPUS.', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': '343347e5-3e65-4f1f-b87d-66a1e3c68b86', 'tool_call_id': 'call_XpB4RoOZt1NZ0X0FBwkLmTkW', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689ab8fb3e684812d15f6f44', 'page_content': '\\\\* correct / len(test\\\\_loader.dataset)}\\')\\n```\\nTypically from here, one could either throw all of this into a python script or run it on a Jupyter Notebook. However, how would you then get this script to run on say two GPUs or on multiple machines if these resources are available, which could improve training speed through \\\\*distributed\\\\* training? Just doing `python myscript.py` will only ever run the script using a single GPU. This is where `torch.distributed` comes into play\\n## PyTorch Distributed Data Parallelism\\nAs the name implies, `torch.distributed` is meant to work on \\\\*distributed\\\\* setups. This can include multi-node, where you have a number of machines each with a single GPU, or multi-gpu where a single system has multiple GPUs, or some combination of both. To convert our above code to work within a distributed setup, a few setup configurations must first be defined, detailed in the [Getting Started with DDP Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp\\\\_tutorial.html)\\nFirst a `setup` and a `cleanup` function must be declared. This will open up a processing group that all of the compute processes can communicate through\\n> Note: for this section of the tutorial it should be assumed these are sent in python script files. Later on a launcher using Accelerate will be discussed that removes this necessity\\n```python\\nimport os\\nimport torch.distributed as dist\\ndef setup(rank, world\\\\_size):\\n\"Sets up the process group and configuration for PyTorch Distributed Data Parallelism\"\\nos.environ[\"MASTER\\\\_ADDR\"] = \\'localhost\\'\\nos.environ[\"MASTER\\\\_PORT\"] = \"12355\"\\n# Initialize the process group\\ndist.init\\\\_process\\\\_group(\"gloo\", rank=rank, world\\\\_size=world\\\\_size)\\ndef cleanup():\\n\"Cleans up the distributed environment\"\\ndist.destroy\\\\_process\\\\_group()\\n```\\nThe last piece of the puzzle is \\\\*how do I send my data and model to another GPU?\\\\*\\nThis is where the `DistributedDataParallel` module comes into play. It will copy your model onto each GPU, and when `loss.backward()` is called the backpropagation is performed and the resulting gradients across all these copies of the model will be averaged/reduced. This ensures each device has the same weights post the optimizer step. Below is an example of our training setup, refactored as a function, with this capability:\\n> Note: Here rank is the overall rank of the current GPU compared to all the other GPUs available, meaning they have a rank of `0 -> n-1`\\n```python\\nfrom torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel as DDP\\ndef train(model, rank, world\\\\_size):\\nsetup(rank, world\\\\_size)\\nmodel = model.to(rank)\\nddp\\\\_model = DDP(model, device\\\\_ids=[rank])\\noptimizer = optim.AdamW(ddp\\\\_model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)\\n# Train for one epoch\\nmodel.train()\\nfor batch\\\\_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(train\\\\_loader):\\ndata, target = data.to(device), target.to(device)\\noutput = model(data)\\nloss = F.nll\\\\_loss(output, target)\\nloss.backward()\\noptimizer.step()\\noptimizer.zero\\\\_grad()\\ncleanup()\\n```\\nThe optimizer needs to be declared based on the model \\\\*on the specific device\\\\* (so `ddp\\\\_model` and not `model`) for all of the gradients to properly be calculated. Lastly, to run the script PyTorch has a convenient `torchrun` command line module that can help. Just pass in the number of nodes it should use as well as the script to run and you are set:\\n```bash\\ntorchrun --nproc\\\\_per\\\\_node=2 --nnodes=1 example\\\\_script.py\\n```\\nThe above will run the training script on two GPUs that live on a single machine and this is the barebones for performing only distributed training with PyTorch.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689aa85f3e684812d15f5be4', 'page_content': '## PyTorch Distributed\\nPyTorch supports [`DistributedDataParallel`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel.html) which enables data parallelism. To start, create a Python file and import `torch.distributed` and `torch.multiprocessing` to set up the distributed process group and to spawn the processes for inference on each GPU. You should also initialize a [`DiffusionPipeline`]:\\n```py\\nimport torch\\nimport torch.distributed as dist\\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\\nfrom diffusers import DiffusionPipeline\\nsd = DiffusionPipeline.from\\\\_pretrained(\\n\"runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5\", torch\\\\_dtype=torch.float16, use\\\\_safetensors=True\\n)\\n```\\nYou\\'ll want to create a function to run inference; [`init\\\\_process\\\\_group`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html?highlight=init\\\\_process\\\\_group#torch.distributed.init\\\\_process\\\\_group) handles creating a distributed environment with the type of backend to use, the `rank` of the current process, and the `world\\\\_size` or the number of processes participating. If you\\'re running inference in parallel over 2 GPUs, then the `world\\\\_size` is 2. Move the [`DiffusionPipeline`] to `rank` and use `get\\\\_rank` to assign a GPU to each process, where each process handles a different prompt:\\n```py\\ndef run\\\\_inference(rank, world\\\\_size):\\ndist.init\\\\_process\\\\_group(\"nccl\", rank=rank, world\\\\_size=world\\\\_size)\\nsd.to(rank)\\nif torch.distributed.get\\\\_rank() == 0:\\nprompt = \"a dog\"\\nelif torch.distributed.get\\\\_rank() == 1:\\nprompt = \"a cat\"\\nimage = sd(prompt).images[0]\\nimage.save(f\"./{\\'\\\\_\\'.join(prompt)}.png\")\\n```\\nTo run the distributed inference, call [`mp.spawn`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/multiprocessing.html#torch.multiprocessing.spawn) to run the `run\\\\_inference` function on the number of GPUs defined in `world\\\\_size`:\\n```py\\ndef main():\\nworld\\\\_size = 2\\nmp.spawn(run\\\\_inference, args=(world\\\\_size,), nprocs=world\\\\_size, join=True)\\nif \\\\_\\\\_name\\\\_\\\\_ == \"\\\\_\\\\_main\\\\_\\\\_\":\\nmain()\\n```\\nOnce you\\'ve completed the inference script, use the `--nproc\\\\_per\\\\_node` argument to specify the number of GPUs to use and call `torchrun` to run the script:\\n```bash\\ntorchrun run\\\\_distributed.py --nproc\\\\_per\\\\_node=2\\n```', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689ab7073e684812d15f6d4c', 'page_content': \"Just add the flag `--fp16` to your command launching one of the scripts mentioned above!

These models are trained on an aesthetic subset of the [LAION-5B dataset](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/) created by the DeepFloyd team at Stability AI, which is then further filtered to remove adult content using [LAION’s NSFW filter](https://openreview.net/forum?id=M3Y74vmsMcY).\\\\*\\nFor more details about how Stable Diffusion 2 works and how it differs from the original Stable Diffusion, please refer to the official [announcement post](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-v2-release).', 'type': 'Document'}}], 'status': 'success'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'messages', 'AIMessage'], 'kwargs': {'content': 'To teach new concepts to Stable Diffusion using Textual Inversion, you need just 3-5 examples.', 'response_metadata': {'finish_reason': 'stop', 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_34a54ae93c'}, 'type': 'ai', 'id': 'run--6afe49e0-22c1-4abe-99c1-aa5cd15c25d3-0', 'usage_metadata': {'input_tokens': 2021, 'output_tokens': 23, 'total_tokens': 2044, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}, 'tool_calls': [], 'invalid_tool_calls': []}}], 'chat_history': []}\n"

In terms of having one single checkpoint when you do `model.save\\\\_pretrained(save\\\\_dir)`, you will end up with several partial checkpoints (each of which being of size < 10GB) and an index that maps parameter names to the files they are stored in. You can control the maximum size before sharding with the `max\\\\_shard\\\\_size` parameter, so for the sake of an example, we\\'ll use a normal-size models with a small shard size: let\\'s take a traditional BERT model. ```py\\nfrom transformers import AutoModel\\nmodel = AutoModel.from\\\\_pretrained(\"bert-base-cased\")\\n```\\nIf you save it using [`~PreTrainedModel.save\\\\_pretrained`], you will get a new folder with two files: the config of the model and its weights:\\n```py\\n>>> import os\\n>>> import tempfile\\n>>> with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp\\\\_dir:\\n... model.save\\\\_pretrained(tmp\\\\_dir)\\n... print(sorted(os.listdir(tmp\\\\_dir)))\\n[\\'config.json\\', \\'pytorch\\\\_model.bin\\']\\n```\\nNow let\\'s use a maximum shard size of 200MB:\\n```py\\n>>> with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp\\\\_dir:\\n... model.save\\\\_pretrained(tmp\\\\_dir, max\\\\_shard\\\\_size=\"200MB\")\\n... print(sorted(os.listdir(tmp\\\\_dir)))\\n[\\'config.json\\', \\'pytorch\\\\_model-00001-of-00003.bin\\', \\'pytorch\\\\_model-00002-of-00003.bin\\', \\'pytorch\\\\_model-00003-of-00003.bin\\', \\'pytorch\\\\_model.bin.index.json\\']\\n```\\nOn top of the configuration of the model, we see three different weights files, and an `index.json` file which is our index.\\n\\nA checkpoint like this can be fully reloaded using the [`~PreTrainedModel.from\\\\_pretrained`] method:\\n```py\\n>>> with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp\\\\_dir:\\n... model.save\\\\_pretrained(tmp\\\\_dir, max\\\\_shard\\\\_size=\"200MB\")\\n... new\\\\_model = AutoModel.from\\\\_pretrained(tmp\\\\_dir)\\n```\\nThe main advantage of doing this for big models is that during step 2 of the workflow shown above, each shard of the checkpoint is loaded after the previous one, capping the memory usage in RAM to the model size plus the size of the biggest shard. Behind the scenes, the index file is used to determine which keys are in the checkpoint, and where the corresponding weights are stored. We can load that index like any json and get a dictionary:\\n```py\\n>>> import json\\n>>> with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp\\\\_dir:\\n... model.save\\\\_pretrained(tmp\\\\_dir, max\\\\_shard\\\\_size=\"200MB\")\\n... with open(os.path.join(tmp\\\\_dir, \"pytorch\\\\_model.bin.index.json\"), \"r\") as f:\\n... index = json.load(f)\\n>>> print(index.keys())\\ndict\\\\_keys([\\'metadata\\', \\'weight\\\\_map\\'])\\n```\\nThe metadata just consists of the total size of the model for now. We plan to add other information in the future:\\n```py\\n>>> index[\"metadata\"]\\n{\\'total\\\\_size\\': 433245184}\\n```\\nThe weights map is the main part of this index, which maps each parameter name (as usually found in a PyTorch model `state\\\\_dict`) to the file it\\'s stored in:\\n```py\\n>>> index[\"weight\\\\_map\"]\\n{\\'embeddings.LayerNorm.bias\\': \\'pytorch\\\\_model-00001-of-00003.bin\\',\\n\\'embeddings.LayerNorm.weight\\': \\'pytorch\\\\_model-00001-of-00003.bin\\',\\n... ```\\nIf you want to directly load such a sharded checkpoint inside a model without using [`~PreTrainedModel.from\\\\_pretrained`] (like you would do `model.load\\\\_state\\\\_dict()` for a full checkpoint) you should use [`~modeling\\\\_utils.load\\\\_sharded\\\\_checkpoint`]:\\n```py\\n>>> from transformers.modeling\\\\_utils import load\\\\_sharded\\\\_checkpoint\\n>>> with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp\\\\_dir:\\n... model.save\\\\_pretrained(tmp\\\\_dir, max\\\\_shard\\\\_size=\"200MB\")\\n... load\\\\_sharded\\\\_checkpoint(model, tmp\\\\_dir)\\n```\\n## Low memory loading\\nSharded checkpoints reduce the memory usage during step 2 of the workflow mentioned above, but in order to use that model in a low memory setting, we recommend leveraging our tools based on the Accelerate library.

While training datasets are [not the sole source of bias](https://www.cell.com/patterns/fulltext/S2666-3899(21)00061-1) in the ML development cycle, they do play a significant role. Does your [dataset disproportionately associate](https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.23/) biographies of women with life events but those of men with achievements? Those \\\\*\\\\*stereotypes\\\\*\\\\* are probably going to show up in your full ML system! Does your voice recognition dataset only feature specific accents? Not a good sign for [the inclusivity of technology](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/speech-recognition-tech-is-yet-another-example-of-bias/) you build with it in terms of \\\\*\\\\*disparate performance\\\\*\\\\*! Whether you’re curating a dataset for ML applications or selecting a dataset to train an ML model, finding out, mitigating, and [communicating](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3479582) to what extent the data exhibits these phenomena are all necessary steps to reducing bias-related risks. You can usually get a pretty good sense of likely biases in a dataset by reflecting on where it comes from, who are the people represented on the data, and what the curation process was. Several frameworks for this reflection and documentation have been proposed such as [Data Statements for NLP](https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.1162/tacl\\\\_a\\\\_00041/43452/Data-Statements-for-Natural-Language-Processing) or [Datasheets for Datasets](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3458723). The Hugging Face Hub includes a Dataset Card [template](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/main/templates/README.md) and [guide](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/main/templates/README\\\\_guide.md#dataset-card-creation-guide) inspired by these works; the section on [considerations for using the data](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/main/templates/README\\\\_guide.md#considerations-for-using-the-data) is usually a good place to look for information about notable biases if you’re browsing datasets, or to write a paragraph sharing your insights on the topic if you’re sharing a new one. And if you’re looking for more inspiration on what to put there, check out these sections written by Hub users in the [BigLAM organization](https://huggingface.co/biglam) for historical datasets of [legal proceedings](https://huggingface.co/datasets/biglam/old\\\\_bailey\\\\_proceedings#social-impact-of-dataset), [image classification](https://huggingface.co/datasets/biglam/brill\\\\_iconclass#social-impact-of-dataset), and [newspapers](https://huggingface.co/datasets/biglam/bnl\\\\_newspapers1841-1879#social-impact-of-dataset). ![HF Dataset Card guide for the Social Impact and Bias Sections](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/ethics_soc_2/img3.png)\\n*[HF Dataset Card guide](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/main/templates/README_guide.md#social-impact-of-dataset) for the Social Impact and Bias Sections*\\n\\nWhile describing the origin and context of a dataset is always a good starting point to understand the biases at play, [quantitatively measuring phenomena](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05129) that encode those biases can be just as helpful.\\n\\n--\\ntitle: \"Let\\'s talk about biases in machine learning!

In their foundational work on [bias in NLP](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.485.pdf), Su Lin Blodgett et al. point out that: \\\\_“[T]he majority of [academic works on machine bias] fail to engage critically with what constitutes “bias” in the first place”\\\\_, including by building their work on top of \\\\_“unstated assumptions about what kinds of system behaviors are harmful, in what ways, to whom, and why”\\\\_. This may not come as much of a surprise given the ML research community’s [focus on the value of “generalization”](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3531146.3533083) — the most cited motivation for work in the field after “performance”. However, while tools for bias assessment that apply to a wide range of settings are valuable to \\\\*\\\\*enable a broader analysis of common trends\\\\*\\\\* in model behaviors, their ability to target the mechanisms that lead to discrimination in \\\\*\\\\*concrete use cases is inherently limited\\\\*\\\\*. Using them to guide specific decisions within the ML development cycle usually requires an extra step or two to take the system’s specific use context and affected people into consideration. ![Excerpt on considerations of ML uses context and people from the Model Card Guidebook](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/ethics_soc_2/img_foresight.png)\\n*Excerpt on considerations of ML uses context and people from the [Model Card Guidebook](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/model-cards)*\\n\\nNow let’s dive deeper into the issue of linking biases in stand-alone/context-less ML artifacts to specific harms.\\n\\nin real time via an API or in batch jobs that run once a day. Memory footprint refers to the size of the model weights and how much hardware memory they occupy. If a model is too large to fit on a single GPU or CPU, then it has to be split over multiple ones, which can be more or less difficult depending on the model architecture and the deployment method. When doing online model evaluation, there is often a trade-off to be done between inference speed and accuracy or precision, whereas this is less the case for offline evaluation. ## Limitations and bias\\nAll models and all metrics have their limitations and biases, which depend on the way in which they were trained, the data that was used, and their intended uses. It is important to measure and communicate these limitations clearly to prevent misuse and unintended impacts, for instance via [model cards](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter4/4?fw=pt) which document the training and evaluation process. Measuring biases can be done by evaluating models on datasets such as [Wino Bias](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wino\\\\_bias) or [MD Gender Bias](https://huggingface.co/datasets/md\\\\_gender\\\\_bias), and by doing [Interactive Error Analyis](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nazneen/error-analysis) to try to identify which subsets of the evaluation dataset a model performs poorly on.

While training datasets are [not the sole source of bias](https://www.cell.com/patterns/fulltext/S2666-3899(21)00061-1) in the ML development cycle, they do play a significant role. Does your [dataset disproportionately associate](https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.23/) biographies of women with life events but those of men with achievements? Those \\\\*\\\\*stereotypes\\\\*\\\\* are probably going to show up in your full ML system! Does your voice recognition dataset only feature specific accents? Not a good sign for [the inclusivity of technology](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/speech-recognition-tech-is-yet-another-example-of-bias/) you build with it in terms of \\\\*\\\\*disparate performance\\\\*\\\\*! Whether you’re curating a dataset for ML applications or selecting a dataset to train an ML model, finding out, mitigating, and [communicating](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3479582) to what extent the data exhibits these phenomena are all necessary steps to reducing bias-related risks. You can usually get a pretty good sense of likely biases in a dataset by reflecting on where it comes from, who are the people represented on the data, and what the curation process was. Several frameworks for this reflection and documentation have been proposed such as [Data Statements for NLP](https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.1162/tacl\\\\_a\\\\_00041/43452/Data-Statements-for-Natural-Language-Processing) or [Datasheets for Datasets](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3458723). The Hugging Face Hub includes a Dataset Card [template](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/main/templates/README.md) and [guide](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/main/templates/README\\\\_guide.md#dataset-card-creation-guide) inspired by these works; the section on [considerations for using the data](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/main/templates/README\\\\_guide.md#considerations-for-using-the-data) is usually a good place to look for information about notable biases if you’re browsing datasets, or to write a paragraph sharing your insights on the topic if you’re sharing a new one.

If you change any parameters such as the outputs height or width, you’ll need to statically reshape your model again. ```python\\n# Define the shapes related to the inputs and desired outputs\\nbatch\\\\_size, num\\\\_images, height, width = 1, 1, 512, 512\\n# Statically reshape the model\\npipeline.reshape(batch\\\\_size, height, width, num\\\\_images)\\n# Compile the model before inference\\npipeline.compile()\\nimage = pipeline(\\nprompt,\\nheight=height,\\nwidth=width,\\nnum\\\\_images\\\\_per\\\\_prompt=num\\\\_images,\\n).images[0]\\n```\\n\\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/optimum/documentation-images/resolve/main/intel/openvino/stable_diffusion_v1_5_sail_boat_rembrandt.png)\\n\\nYou can find more examples in the 🤗 Optimum [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/inference#stable-diffusion), and Stable Diffusion is supported for text-to-image, image-to-image, and inpainting. ## Stable Diffusion XL\\nTo load and run inference with SDXL, use the [`~optimum.intel.OVStableDiffusionXLPipeline`]:\\n```python\\nfrom optimum.intel import OVStableDiffusionXLPipeline\\nmodel\\\\_id = \"stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0\"\\npipeline = OVStableDiffusionXLPipeline.from\\\\_pretrained(model\\\\_id)\\nprompt = \"sailing ship in storm by Rembrandt\"\\nimage = pipeline(prompt).images[0]\\n```\\nTo further speed-up inference, [statically reshape](#stable-diffusion) the model as shown in the Stable Diffusion section.\\n\\n![ONNX Runtime](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/actions/workflows/test\\\\_onnxruntime.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/actions/workflows/test\\\\_onnxruntime.yml)\\n# Hugging Face Optimum\\n🤗 Optimum is an extension of 🤗 Transformers and Diffusers, providing a set of optimization tools enabling maximum efficiency to train and run models on targeted hardware, while keeping things easy to use. ## Installation\\n🤗 Optimum can be installed using `pip` as follows:\\n```bash\\npython -m pip install optimum\\n```\\nIf you\\'d like to use the accelerator-specific features of 🤗 Optimum, you can install the required dependencies according to the table below:\\n| Accelerator | Installation |\\n|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|\\n| [ONNX Runtime](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/onnxruntime/overview) | `pip install --upgrade-strategy eager optimum[onnxruntime]` |\\n| [Intel Neural Compressor](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/index) | `pip install --upgrade-strategy eager optimum[neural-compressor]`|\\n| [OpenVINO](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/index) | `pip install --upgrade-strategy eager optimum[openvino,nncf]` |\\n| [AMD Instinct GPUs and Ryzen AI NPU](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/amd/index) | `pip install --upgrade-strategy eager optimum[amd]` |\\n| [Habana Gaudi Processor (HPU)](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/habana/index) | `pip install --upgrade-strategy eager optimum[habana]` |\\n| [FuriosaAI](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/furiosa/index) | `pip install --upgrade-strategy eager optimum[furiosa]` |\\nThe `--upgrade-strategy eager` option is needed to ensure the different packages are upgraded to the latest possible version.
