It enables zero-shot subject-driven generation and control-guided zero-shot generation. The abstract from the paper is:\\n\\\\*Subject-driven text-to-image generation models create novel renditions of an input subject based on text prompts. Existing models suffer from lengthy fine-tuning and difficulties preserving the subject fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce BLIP-Diffusion, a new subject-driven image generation model that supports multimodal control which consumes inputs of subject images and text prompts. Unlike other subject-driven generation models, BLIP-Diffusion introduces a new multimodal encoder which is pre-trained to provide subject representation. We first pre-train the multimodal encoder following BLIP-2 to produce visual representation aligned with the text. Then we design a subject representation learning task which enables a diffusion model to leverage such visual representation and generates new subject renditions. Compared with previous methods such as DreamBooth, our model enables zero-shot subject-driven generation, and efficient fine-tuning for customized subject with up to 20x speedup. We also demonstrate that BLIP-Diffusion can be flexibly combined with existing techniques such as ControlNet and prompt-to-prompt to enable novel subject-driven generation and editing applications. Project page at [this https URL](https://dxli94.github.io/BLIP-Diffusion-website/).\\\\*\\nThe original codebase can be found at [salesforce/LAVIS](https://github.com/salesforce/LAVIS/tree/main/projects/blip-diffusion). You can find the official BLIP-Diffusion checkpoints under the [hf.co/SalesForce](https://hf.co/SalesForce) organization. `BlipDiffusionPipeline` and `BlipDiffusionControlNetPipeline` were contributed by [`ayushtues`](https://github.com/ayushtues/). Make sure to check out the Schedulers [guide](../../using-diffusers/schedulers) to learn how to explore the tradeoff between scheduler speed and quality, and see the [reuse components across pipelines](../../using-diffusers/loading#reuse-components-across-pipelines) section to learn how to efficiently load the same components into multiple pipelines. ## BlipDiffusionPipeline\\n[[autodoc]] BlipDiffusionPipeline\\n- all\\n- \\\\_\\\\_call\\\\_\\\\_\\n## BlipDiffusionControlNetPipeline\\n[[autodoc]] BlipDiffusionControlNetPipeline\\n- all\\n- \\\\_\\\\_call\\\\_\\\\_\\n\\nThe Stable Diffusion model is distributed under the CreateML OpenRail-M license. It\\'s an open license that claims no rights on the outputs you generate and prohibits you from deliberately producing illegal or harmful content. The [model card](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4) provides more details, so take a moment to read them and consider carefully whether you accept the license. If you do, you need to be a registered user in the Hub and use an access token for the code to work. You have two options to provide your access token:\\n- Use the `huggingface-cli login` command-line tool in your terminal and paste your token when prompted. It will be saved in a file in your computer. - Or use `notebook\\\\_login()` in a notebook, which does the same thing. The following cell will present a login interface unless you\\'ve already authenticated before in this computer. You\\'ll need to paste your access token. ``` python\\nif not (Path.home()/\\'.huggingface\\'/\\'token\\').exists(): notebook\\\\_login()\\n```\\nTPU devices support `bfloat16`, an efficient half-float type. We\\'ll use it for our tests, but you can also use `float32` to use full precision instead. ``` python\\ndtype = jnp.bfloat16\\n```\\nFlax is a functional framework, so models are stateless and parameters are stored outside them. Loading the pre-trained Flax pipeline will return both the pipeline itself and the model weights (or parameters). We are using a `bf16` version of the weights, which leads to type warnings that you can safely ignore. ``` python\\npipeline, params = FlaxStableDiffusionPipeline.from\\\\_pretrained(\\n\"CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4\",\\nrevision=\"bf16\",\\ndtype=dtype,\\n)\\n```\\n## Inference\\nSince TPUs usually have 8 devices working in parallel, we\\'ll replicate our prompt as many times as devices we have.\\n\\n!--Copyright 2023 The HuggingFace Team.

It enables zero-shot subject-driven generation and control-guided zero-shot generation. The abstract from the paper is:\\n\\\\*Subject-driven text-to-image generation models create novel renditions of an input subject based on text prompts. Existing models suffer from lengthy fine-tuning and difficulties preserving the subject fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce BLIP-Diffusion, a new subject-driven image generation model that supports multimodal control which consumes inputs of subject images and text prompts. Unlike other subject-driven generation models, BLIP-Diffusion introduces a new multimodal encoder which is pre-trained to provide subject representation. We first pre-train the multimodal encoder following BLIP-2 to produce visual representation aligned with the text. Then we design a subject representation learning task which enables a diffusion model to leverage such visual representation and generates new subject renditions. Compared with previous methods such as DreamBooth, our model enables zero-shot subject-driven generation, and efficient fine-tuning for customized subject with up to 20x speedup. We also demonstrate that BLIP-Diffusion can be flexibly combined with existing techniques such as ControlNet and prompt-to-prompt to enable novel subject-driven generation and editing applications.

Datasets Server provides the `/is-valid` endpoint to check if a specific dataset works without any errors. The API endpoint will return an error for datasets that cannot be loaded with the [ü§ó Datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) library, for example, because the data hasn\\'t been uploaded or the format is not supported. The largest datasets are partially supported by Datasets Server. If they are{\" \"}\\n[streamable](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/stream), Datasets\\nServer can extract the first 100 rows without downloading the whole dataset. This is especially useful for previewing large datasets where downloading the\\nwhole dataset may take hours!

Two things should be noted here:\\n1. Keeping all the context is crucial for LLMs deployed in chat so that the LLM understands all the previous context of the conversation. E.g. for the example above the LLM needs to understand that the user refers to the population when asking `\"And how many are in Germany\"`. 2. The key-value cache is extremely useful for chat as it allows us to continuously grow the encoded chat history instead of having to re-encode the chat history again from scratch (as e.g. would be the case when using an encoder-decoder architecture). There is however one catch. While the required peak memory for the \\\\\\\\( \\\\mathbf{QK}^T \\\\\\\\) matrix is significantly reduced, holding the key-value cache in memory can become very memory expensive for long input sequences or multi-turn chat.

Let\\'s compute the number of float values that need to be stored in the key-value cache for the LLM `bigcode/octocoder` that we used before. The number of float values amounts to two times the sequence length times the number of attention heads times the attention head dimension and times the number of layers. Computing this for our LLM at a hypothetical input sequence length of 16000 gives:\\n```python\\nconfig = model.config\\n2 \\\\* 16\\\\_000 \\\\* config.n\\\\_layer \\\\* config.n\\\\_head \\\\* config.n\\\\_embd // config.n\\\\_head\\n```\\n\\\\*\\\\*Output\\\\*\\\\*:\\n```\\n7864320000\\n```\\nRoughly 8 billion float values! Storing 8 billion float values in `float16` precision requires around 15 GB of RAM which is circa half as much as the model weights themselves! Researchers have proposed two methods that allow to significantly reduce the memory cost of storing the key-value cache:\\n1. [Multi-Query-Attention (MQA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02150)\\nMulti-Query-Attention was proposed in Noam Shazeer\\'s \\\\*Fast Transformer Decoding: One Write-Head is All You Need\\\\* paper. As the title says, Noam found out that instead of using `n\\\\_head` key-value projections weights, one can use a single head-value projection weight pair that is shared across all attention heads without that the model\\'s performance significantly degrades. > By using a single head-value projection weight pair, the key value vectors \\\\\\\\( \\\\mathbf{k}\\\\_i, \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\_i \\\\\\\\) have to be identical across all attention heads which in turn means that we only need to store 1 key-value projection pair in the cache instead of `n\\\\_head` ones. As most LLMs use between 20 and 100 attention heads, MQA significantly reduces the memory consumption of the key-value cache. For the LLM used in this notebook we could therefore reduce the required memory consumption from 15 GB to less than 400 MB at an input sequence length of 16000. In addition to memory savings, MQA also leads to improved computational efficiency as explained in the following. In auto-regressive decoding, large key-value vectors need to be reloaded, concatenated with the current key-value vector pair to be then fed into the \\\\\\\\( \\\\mathbf{q}\\\\_c\\\\mathbf{K}^T \\\\\\\\) computation at every step. For auto-regressive decoding, the required memory bandwidth for the constant reloading can become a serious time bottleneck. By reducing the size of the key-value vectors less memory needs to be accessed, thus reducing the memory bandwidth bottleneck. For more detail, please have a look at [Noam\\'s paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02150). The important part to understand here is that reducing the number of key-value attention heads to 1 only makes sense if a key-value cache is used. The peak memory consumption of the model for a single forward pass without key-value cache stays unchanged as every attention head still has a unique query vector so that each attention head still has a different \\\\\\\\( \\\\mathbf{QK}^T \\\\\\\\) matrix. MQA has seen wide adoption by the community and is now used by many of the most popular LLMs:\\n- [\\\\*\\\\*Falcon\\\\*\\\\*](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b)\\n- [\\\\*\\\\*PaLM\\\\*\\\\*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02311)\\n- [\\\\*\\\\*MPT\\\\*\\\\*](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-30b)\\n- [\\\\*\\\\*BLOOM\\\\*\\\\*](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom)\\nAlso, the checkpoint used in this notebook - `bigcode/octocoder` - makes use of MQA.\\n\\nLong story short, the default self-attention algorithm quickly becomes prohibitively memory-expensive for large input contexts. As LLMs improve in text comprehension and generation, they are applied to increasingly complex tasks. While models once handled the translation or summarization of a few sentences, they now manage entire pages, demanding the capability to process extensive input lengths. How can we get rid of the exorbitant memory requirements for large input lengths? We need a new way to compute the self-attention mechanism that gets rid of the \\\\\\\\( QK^T \\\\\\\\) matrix. [Tri Dao et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135) developed exactly such a new algorithm and called it \\\\*\\\\*Flash Attention\\\\*\\\\*. In a nutshell, Flash Attention breaks the \\\\\\\\(\\\\mathbf{V} \\\\times \\\\text{Softmax}(\\\\mathbf{QK}^T\\\\\\\\)) computation apart and instead computes smaller chunks of the output by iterating over multiple softmax computation steps:\\n$$ \\\\textbf{O}\\\\_i \\\\leftarrow s^a\\\\_{ij} \\\\* \\\\textbf{O}\\\\_i + s^b\\\\_{ij} \\\\* \\\\mathbf{V}\\\\_{j} \\\\times \\\\text{Softmax}(\\\\mathbf{QK}^T\\\\_{i,j}) \\\\text{ for multiple } i, j \\\\text{ iterations} $$\\nwith \\\\\\\\( s^a\\\\_{ij} \\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\( s^b\\\\_{ij} \\\\\\\\) being some softmax normalization statistics that need to be recomputed for every \\\\\\\\( i \\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\( j \\\\\\\\) . Please note that the whole Flash Attention is a bit more complex and is greatly simplified here as going in too much depth is out of scope for this guide. The reader is invited to take a look at the well-written [Flash Attention paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135) for more details. The main takeaway here is:\\n> By keeping track of softmax normalization statistics and by using some smart mathematics, Flash Attention gives \\\\*\\\\*numerical identical\\\\*\\\\* outputs compared to the default self-attention layer at a memory cost that only increases linearly with \\\\\\\\( N \\\\\\\\) . Looking at the formula, one would intuitively say that Flash Attention must be much slower compared to the default self-attention formula as more computation needs to be done. Indeed Flash Attention requires more FLOPs compared to normal attention as the softmax normalization statistics have to constantly be recomputed (see [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135) for more details if interested)\\n> However, Flash Attention is much faster in inference compared to default attention which comes from its ability to significantly reduce the demands on the slower, high-bandwidth memory of the GPU (VRAM), focusing instead on the faster on-chip memory (SRAM). Essentially, Flash Attention makes sure that all intermediate write and read operations can be done using the fast \\\\*on-chip\\\\* SRAM memory instead of having to access the slower VRAM memory to compute the output vector \\\\\\\\( \\\\mathbf{O} \\\\\\\\) . In practice, there is currently absolutely no reason to \\\\*\\\\*not\\\\*\\\\* use Flash Attention if available.\\n\\nThis can adversely affect their ability to model long-range phenomena common in images, such as symmetry and occlusion, especially with a small number of layers. Growing the receptive field has been shown to improve quality significantly (Salimans et al.). Doing so, however, comes at a significant cost in number of parameters and consequently computational performance and can make training such models more challenging. >\\n> ... self-attention can achieve a better balance in the trade-off between the virtually unlimited receptive field of the necessarily sequential PixelRNN and the limited receptive field of the much more parallelizable PixelCNN and its various extensions. [Image Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05751) uses transformers by restricting self attention over local neighborhoods of pixels. [Taming Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09841) and [DALL-E 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12092) combine convolutions and transformers. Both train a VQ-VAE to learn a discrete latent space, and then a transformer is trained in the compressed latent space. The transformer context is global but masked, because attention is provided over all previously predicted latent pixels, but the model is still AR so attention cannot be provided over not yet predicted pixels.

Essentially, Flash Attention makes sure that all intermediate write and read operations can be done using the fast \\\\*on-chip\\\\* SRAM memory instead of having to access the slower VRAM memory to compute the output vector \\\\\\\\( \\\\mathbf{O} \\\\\\\\) . In practice, there is currently absolutely no reason to \\\\*\\\\*not\\\\*\\\\* use Flash Attention if available.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 19, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.9987889'}}, 'page_content': 'This can adversely affect their ability to model long-range phenomena common in images, such as symmetry and occlusion, especially with a small number of layers.

[Image Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05751) uses transformers by restricting self attention over local neighborhoods of pixels.

The transformer context is global but masked, because attention is provided over all previously predicted latent pixels, but the model is still AR so attention cannot be provided over not yet predicted pixels.

Current approaches that use textual coordinates or spatial encodings often fail to provide a user-friendly interface for visual prompting. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel multimodal model capable of decoding arbitrary visual prompts. This allows users to intuitively mark images and interact with the model using natural cues like a \"red bounding box\" or \"pointed arrow\". Our simple design directly overlays visual markers onto the RGB image, eliminating the need for complex region encodings, yet achieves state-of-the-art performance on region-understanding tasks like Visual7W, PointQA, and Visual Commonsense Reasoning benchmark. Furthermore, we present ViP-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark to assess the capability of models in understanding visual prompts across multiple dimensions, enabling future research in this domain. Code, data, and model are publicly available.\\\\*\\nTips:\\n- The architecture is similar than llava architecture except that the multi-modal projector takes a set of concatenated vision hidden states and has an additional layernorm layer on that module.\\n\\n!--Copyright 2023 The HuggingFace Team.

For instance, large language models can handle such NLP tasks as summarization, translation, classification, and more. This approach is no longer limited to a single modality, such as text, and in this guide, we will illustrate how you can\\nsolve image-text tasks with a large multimodal model called IDEFICS. [IDEFICS](../model\\\\_doc/idefics) is an open-access vision and language model based on [Flamingo](https://huggingface.co/papers/2204.14198),\\na state-of-the-art visual language model initially developed by DeepMind. The model accepts arbitrary sequences of image\\nand text inputs and generates coherent text as output. It can answer questions about images, describe visual content,\\ncreate stories grounded in multiple images, and so on. IDEFICS comes in two variants - [80 billion parameters](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceM4/idefics-80b)\\nand [9 billion parameters](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceM4/idefics-9b), both of which are available on the ü§ó Hub.\\n\\nThe largest model has 1.6 trillion parameters. - [NLLB MoE (Meta)](https://huggingface.co/facebook/nllb-moe-54b): A MoE variant of the NLLB translation model. - [OpenMoE](https://huggingface.co/fuzhao): A community effort that has released Llama-based MoEs. - [Mixtral 8x7B (Mistral)](https://huggingface.co/mistralai): A high-quality MoE that outperforms Llama 2 70B and has much faster inference. A instruct-tuned model is also released. Read more about it in [the announcement blog post](https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/). ## Exciting directions of work\\nFurther experiments on \\\\*\\\\*distilling\\\\*\\\\* a sparse MoE back to a dense model with less parameters but similar number of parameters.

Current approaches that use textual coordinates or spatial encodings often fail to provide a user-friendly interface for visual prompting. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel multimodal model capable of decoding arbitrary visual prompts. This allows users to intuitively mark images and interact with the model using natural cues like a \"red bounding box\" or \"pointed arrow\". Our simple design directly overlays visual markers onto the RGB image, eliminating the need for complex region encodings, yet achieves state-of-the-art performance on region-understanding tasks like Visual7W, PointQA, and Visual Commonsense Reasoning benchmark. Furthermore, we present ViP-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark to assess the capability of models in understanding visual prompts across multiple dimensions, enabling future research in this domain.

For instance, large language models can handle such NLP tasks as summarization, translation, classification, and more. This approach is no longer limited to a single modality, such as text, and in this guide, we will illustrate how you can\\nsolve image-text tasks with a large multimodal model called IDEFICS. [IDEFICS](../model\\\\_doc/idefics) is an open-access vision and language model based on [Flamingo](https://huggingface.co/papers/2204.14198),\\na state-of-the-art visual language model initially developed by DeepMind. The model accepts arbitrary sequences of image\\nand text inputs and generates coherent text as output. It can answer questions about images, describe visual content,\\ncreate stories grounded in multiple images, and so on. IDEFICS comes in two variants - [80 billion parameters](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceM4/idefics-80b)\\nand [9 billion parameters](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceM4/idefics-9b), both of which are available on the ü§ó Hub.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 6, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.9968212'}}, 'page_content': 'The largest model has 1.6 trillion parameters. - [NLLB MoE (Meta)](https://huggingface.co/facebook/nllb-moe-54b): A MoE variant of the NLLB translation model. - [OpenMoE](https://huggingface.co/fuzhao): A community effort that has released Llama-based MoEs. - [Mixtral 8x7B (Mistral)](https://huggingface.co/mistralai): A high-quality MoE that outperforms Llama 2 70B and has much faster inference.

For example, you might want to:\\n- Group together related demos as multiple tabs in one web application\\n- Change the layout of your demo, e.g. to specify where the inputs and outputs are located\\n- Have multi-step interfaces, in which the output of one model becomes the input to the next model, or have more flexible data flows in general\\n- Change a component\\'s properties (for example, the choices in a dropdown) or its visibility based on user input\\nWe will explore all of these concepts below. ### Creating a simple demo using Blocks[[creating-a-simple-demo-using-blocks]]\\nAfter you have installed Gradio, run the code below as a Python script, a Jupyter notebook, or a Colab notebook. ```py\\nimport gradio as gr\\ndef flip\\\\_text(x):\\nreturn x[::-1]\\ndemo = gr.Blocks()\\nwith demo:\\ngr.Markdown(\\n\"\"\"\\n# Flip Text!

In the Cloud Console, click on the hamburger menu in the top-left corner and select \"APIs & Services\" from the menu. If you do not have an existing project, you will need to create one. 3. Then, click the \"+ Enabled APIs & services\" button, which allows you to enable specific services for your project. Search for \"BigQuery API\", click on it, and click the \"Enable\" button.

However, at some point further model increases become harder due to GPU/TPU memory limitations,\\nlonger training times, and unexpected model degradation. To address these problems, we present two parameter-reduction\\ntechniques to lower memory consumption and increase the training speed of BERT. Comprehensive empirical evidence shows\\nthat our proposed methods lead to models that scale much better compared to the original BERT. We also use a\\nself-supervised loss that focuses on modeling inter-sentence coherence, and show it consistently helps downstream tasks\\nwith multi-sentence inputs. As a result, our best model establishes new state-of-the-art results on the GLUE, RACE, and\\nSQuAD benchmarks while having fewer parameters compared to BERT-large.\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [lysandre](https://huggingface.co/lysandre). This model jax version was contributed by\\n[kamalkraj](https://huggingface.co/kamalkraj). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/ALBERT). ## Usage tips\\n- ALBERT is a model with absolute position embeddings so it's usually advised to pad the inputs on the right rather\\nthan the left. - ALBERT uses repeating layers which results in a small memory footprint, however the computational cost remains\\nsimilar to a BERT-like architecture with the same number of hidden layers as it has to iterate through the same\\nnumber of (repeating) layers. - Embedding size E is different from hidden size H justified because the embeddings are context independent (one embedding vector represents one token), whereas hidden states are context dependent (one hidden state represents a sequence of tokens) so it's more logical to have H >> E. Also, the embedding matrix is large since it's V x E (V being the vocab size). If E < H, it has less parameters. - Layers are split in groups that share parameters (to save memory). Next sentence prediction is replaced by a sentence ordering prediction: in the inputs, we have two sentences A and B (that are consecutive) and we either feed A followed by B or B followed by A.\\n\\n--\\ntitle: Hyperparameter Search with Transformers and Ray Tune\\nthumbnail: /blog/assets/06\\\\_ray\\\\_tune/ray-hf.jpg\\nauthors:\\n- user: ray-project\\nguest: true\\n---\\n# Hyperparameter Search with Transformers and Ray Tune\\n##### A guest blog post by Richard Liaw from the Anyscale team\\nWith cutting edge research implementations, thousands of trained models easily accessible, the Hugging Face [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library has become critical to the success and growth of natural language processing today. For any machine learning model to achieve good performance, users often need to implement some form of parameter tuning. Yet, nearly everyone ([1](https://medium.com/@prakashakshay90/fine-tuning-bert-model-using-pytorch-f34148d58a37), [2](https://mccormickml.com/2019/07/22/BERT-fine-tuning/#advantages-of-fine-tuning)) either ends up disregarding hyperparameter tuning or opting to do a simplistic grid search with a small search space. However, simple experiments are able to show the benefit of using an advanced tuning technique. Below is [a recent experiment run on a BERT](https://medium.com/distributed-computing-with-ray/hyperparameter-optimization-for-transformers-a-guide-c4e32c6c989b) model from [Hugging Face transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) on the [RTE dataset](https://aclweb.org/aclwiki/Textual\\\\_Entailment\\\\_Resource\\\\_Pool). Genetic optimization techniques like [PBT](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/api\\\\_docs/schedulers.html#population-based-training-tune-schedulers-populationbasedtraining) can provide large performance improvements compared to standard hyperparameter optimization techniques. |  |  |  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| **Algorithm** | **Best Val Acc.** | **Best Test Acc.** | **Total GPU min** | **Total $ cost** |\\n| Grid Search | 74% | 65.4% | 45 min | $2.30 |\\n| Bayesian Optimization +Early Stop | 77% | 66.9% | 104 min | $5.30 |\\n| Population-based Training | 78% | 70.5% | 48 min | $2.45 |\\n\\nIf you‚Äôre leveraging [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers), you‚Äôll want to have a way to easily access powerful hyperparameter tuning solutions without giving up the customizability of the Transformers framework.\\n\\nAn intuition would be that these preference models need to have similar capacity to understand the text given to them as a model would need in order to generate said text. At this point in the RLHF system, we have an initial language model that can be used to generate text and a preference model that takes in any text and assigns it a score of how well humans perceive it.

However, at some point further model increases become harder due to GPU/TPU memory limitations,\\nlonger training times, and unexpected model degradation. To address these problems, we present two parameter-reduction\\ntechniques to lower memory consumption and increase the training speed of BERT. Comprehensive empirical evidence shows\\nthat our proposed methods lead to models that scale much better compared to the original BERT. We also use a\\nself-supervised loss that focuses on modeling inter-sentence coherence, and show it consistently helps downstream tasks\\nwith multi-sentence inputs. As a result, our best model establishes new state-of-the-art results on the GLUE, RACE, and\\nSQuAD benchmarks while having fewer parameters compared to BERT-large.\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [lysandre](https://huggingface.co/lysandre). This model jax version was contributed by\\n[kamalkraj](https://huggingface.co/kamalkraj). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/ALBERT). ## Usage tips\\n- ALBERT is a model with absolute position embeddings so it's usually advised to pad the inputs on the right rather\\nthan the left. - ALBERT uses repeating layers which results in a small memory footprint, however the computational cost remains\\nsimilar to a BERT-like architecture with the same number of hidden layers as it has to iterate through the same\\nnumber of (repeating) layers. - Embedding size E is different from hidden size H justified because the embeddings are context independent (one embedding vector represents one token), whereas hidden states are context dependent (one hidden state represents a sequence of tokens) so it's more logical to have H >> E. Also, the embedding matrix is large since it's V x E (V being the vocab size). If E < H, it has less parameters. - Layers are split in groups that share parameters (to save memory). Next sentence prediction is replaced by a sentence ordering prediction: in the inputs, we have two sentences A and B (that are consecutive) and we either feed A followed by B or B followed by A.\", 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 17, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.98999983'}}, 'page_content': '--\\ntitle: Hyperparameter Search with Transformers and Ray Tune\\nthumbnail: /blog/assets/06\\\\_ray\\\\_tune/ray-hf.jpg\\nauthors:\\n- user: ray-project\\nguest: true\\n---\\n# Hyperparameter Search with Transformers and Ray Tune\\n##### A guest blog post by Richard Liaw from the Anyscale team\\nWith cutting edge research implementations, thousands of trained models easily accessible, the Hugging Face [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library has become critical to the success and growth of natural language processing today. For any machine learning model to achieve good performance, users often need to implement some form of parameter tuning. Yet, nearly everyone ([1](https://medium.com/@prakashakshay90/fine-tuning-bert-model-using-pytorch-f34148d58a37), [2](https://mccormickml.com/2019/07/22/BERT-fine-tuning/#advantages-of-fine-tuning)) either ends up disregarding hyperparameter tuning or opting to do a simplistic grid search with a small search space. However, simple experiments are able to show the benefit of using an advanced tuning technique. Below is [a recent experiment run on a BERT](https://medium.com/distributed-computing-with-ray/hyperparameter-optimization-for-transformers-a-guide-c4e32c6c989b) model from [Hugging Face transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) on the [RTE dataset](https://aclweb.org/aclwiki/Textual\\\\_Entailment\\\\_Resource\\\\_Pool).

Some datasets on the ü§ó Hub are already separated into these three splits. However, there are also many that only have a train/validation or only train split. If the dataset you\\'re using doesn\\'t have a predefined train-test split, it is up to you to define which part of the dataset you want to use for training your model and which you want to use for hyperparameter tuning or final evaluation.

If you overfit on your training data the evaluation results on that split will look great but the model will perform poorly on new data. Depending on the size of the dataset, you can keep anywhere from 10-30% for evaluation and the rest for training, while aiming to set up the test set to reflect the production data as close as possible. Check out [this thread](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/how-to-split-main-dataset-into-train-dev-test-as-datasetdict/1090) for a more in-depth discussion of dataset splitting! ## The impact of class imbalance\\nWhile many academic datasets, such as the [IMDb dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imdb) of movie reviews, are perfectly balanced, most real-world datasets are not. In machine learning a \\\\*balanced dataset\\\\* corresponds to a datasets where all labels are represented equally. In the case of the IMDb dataset this means that there are as many positive as negative reviews in the dataset. In an imbalanced dataset this is not the case: in fraud detection for example there are usually many more non-fraud cases than fraud cases in the dataset. Having an imbalanced dataset can skew the results of your metrics. Imagine a dataset with 99 \"non-fraud\" cases and 1 \"fraud\" case. A simple model that always predicts \"non-fraud\" cases would give yield a 99% accuracy which might sound good at first until you realize that you will never catch a fraud case.\\n\\nIntroduction[[introduction]]\\nIn [Chapter 3](/course/chapter3) you got your first taste of the ü§ó Datasets library and saw that there were three main steps when it came to fine-tuning a model:\\n1.

We created a detailed benchmark with over 190 different configurations sharing the results you can expect when using Hugging Face Infinity on CPU, what would be the best configuration to optimize your Infinity Container for latency, and what would be the best configuration to maximize throughput. Hugging Face Infinity can deliver up to 800% higher throughput compared to vanilla transformers, and down to 1-4ms latency for sequence lengths up to 64 tokens. The flexibility to optimize transformer models for throughput, latency, or both enables businesses to either reduce the amount of infrastructure cost for the same workload or to enable real-time use cases that were not possible before.

Latency (Batch=1, Physical Cores=2)\\n\\n---\\n## Conclusion\\nIn this post, we showed how Hugging Face Infinity performs on the new Intel Ice Lake Xeon CPU. We created a detailed benchmark with over 190 different configurations sharing the results you can expect when using Hugging Face Infinity on CPU, what would be the best configuration to optimize your Infinity Container for latency, and what would be the best configuration to maximize throughput. Hugging Face Infinity can deliver up to 800% higher throughput compared to vanilla transformers, and down to 1-4ms latency for sequence lengths up to 64 tokens. The flexibility to optimize transformer models for throughput, latency, or both enables businesses to either reduce the amount of infrastructure cost for the same workload or to enable real-time use cases that were not possible before.

Their success can be attributed to the self-attention mechanism, which captures the pairwise interactions between all the tokens in an input. However, the standard self-attention mechanism has a time and memory complexity of \\\\\\\\(O(n^2)\\\\\\\\) (where \\\\\\\\(n\\\\\\\\) is the length of the input sequence), making it expensive to train on long input sequences. The [Nystr√∂mformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03902) is one of many efficient Transformer models that approximates standard self-attention with \\\\\\\\(O(n)\\\\\\\\) complexity. Nystr√∂mformer exhibits competitive performance on various downstream NLP and CV tasks while improving upon the efficiency of standard self-attention. The aim of this blog post is to give readers an overview of the Nystr√∂m method and how it can be adapted to approximate self-attention. ## Nystr√∂m method for matrix approximation\\nAt the heart of Nystr√∂mformer is the Nystr√∂m method for matrix approximation.

Their success can be attributed to the self-attention mechanism, which captures the pairwise interactions between all the tokens in an input. However, the standard self-attention mechanism has a time and memory complexity of \\\\\\\\(O(n^2)\\\\\\\\) (where \\\\\\\\(n\\\\\\\\) is the length of the input sequence), making it expensive to train on long input sequences. The [Nystr√∂mformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03902) is one of many efficient Transformer models that approximates standard self-attention with \\\\\\\\(O(n)\\\\\\\\) complexity. Nystr√∂mformer exhibits competitive performance on various downstream NLP and CV tasks while improving upon the efficiency of standard self-attention. The aim of this blog post is to give readers an overview of the Nystr√∂m method and how it can be adapted to approximate self-attention. ## Nystr√∂m method for matrix approximation\\nAt the heart of Nystr√∂mformer is the Nystr√∂m method for matrix approximation. It allows us to approximate a matrix by sampling some of its rows and columns. Let\\'s consider a matrix \\\\\\\\(P^{n \\\\times n}\\\\\\\\), which is expensive to compute in its entirety. So, instead, we approximate it using the Nystr√∂m method. We start by sampling \\\\\\\\(m\\\\\\\\) rows and columns from \\\\\\\\(P\\\\\\\\). We can then arrange the sampled rows and columns as follows:\\n\\nRepresenting P as a block matrix\\n\\nWe now have four submatrices: \\\\\\\\(A\\\\_P, B\\\\_P, F\\\\_P,\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\(C\\\\_P\\\\\\\\), with sizes \\\\\\\\(m \\\\times m, m \\\\times (n - m), (n - m) \\\\times m\\\\\\\\) and\\n\\\\\\\\((n - m) \\\\times (n - m)\\\\\\\\) respectively. The \\\\\\\\(m\\\\\\\\) sampled columns are contained in \\\\\\\\(A\\\\_P\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\(F\\\\_P\\\\\\\\), whereas the \\\\\\\\(m\\\\\\\\) sampled rows are contained in \\\\\\\\(A\\\\_P\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\(B\\\\_P\\\\\\\\). So, the entries of \\\\\\\\(A\\\\_P, B\\\\_P,\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\(F\\\\_P\\\\\\\\) are known to us, and we will estimate \\\\\\\\(C\\\\_P\\\\\\\\).

Question answering models take a context, which is the document you want to search in, and a question and return an answer. Note that the answer is not generated, but extracted from the context. This type of question answering is called extractive. The task is evaluated on two metrics, exact match and F1-Score.

Token classification regroups any task that can be framed as labelling each word (or token) in a sentence, like identifying the persons, organizations and locations for instance.

If you have your own dataset for token classification, just make sure you clean your data to get to the same point, with one column containing words (as list of strings) and another containing labels (as integers spanning from to to your number of labels -1).() Make sure you have your label names stored somewhere - here we get them from the dataset features - so you are able to map the integers to some real labels when inspecting your data! Here we are doing named entity recognitions, so ours labels are either O for words that do not belong to any entity, LOC, for location, PER, for person, ORG for organization and MISC for miscellaneous.

We can add that information later if needed. - Stride: No striding, all tensors need to be packed before being serialized. I have yet to see a case where it seems useful to have a strided tensor stored in serialized format. ### Benefits\\nSince we can invent a new format we can propose additional benefits:\\n- Prevent DOS attacks: We can craft the format in such a way that it\\'s almost\\nimpossible to use malicious files to DOS attack a user. Currently, there\\'s a limit\\non the size of the header of 100MB to prevent parsing extremely large JSON. Also when reading the file, there\\'s a guarantee that addresses in the file\\ndo not overlap in any way, meaning when you\\'re loading a file you should never\\nexceed the size of the file in memory\\n- Faster load: PyTorch seems to be the fastest file to load out in the major\\nML formats. However, it does seem to have an extra copy on CPU, which we\\ncan bypass in this lib by using `torch.UntypedStorage.from\\\\_file`. Currently, CPU loading times are extremely fast with this lib compared to pickle. GPU loading times are as fast or faster than PyTorch equivalent. Loading first on CPU with memmapping with torch, and then moving all tensors to GPU seems\\nto be faster too somehow (similar behavior in torch pickle)\\n- Lazy loading: in distributed (multi-node or multi-gpu) settings, it\\'s nice to be able to\\nload only part of the tensors on the various models.

There‚Äôs just one problem ‚Äì you don‚Äôt know how to code! üò± Or maybe you‚Äôre a seasoned software engineer who wants to add some ML to your side-project, but you don‚Äôt have the time to pick up a whole new tech stack! For many people, the technical barriers to picking up machine learning feel insurmountable. That‚Äôs why Hugging Face created [AutoTrain](https://huggingface.co/autotrain), and with the latest feature we‚Äôve just added, we‚Äôre making ‚Äúno-code‚Äù machine learning better than ever. Best of all, you can create your first project for ‚ú® free! ‚ú®\\n[Hugging Face AutoTrain](https://huggingface.co/autotrain) lets you train models with \\\\*\\\\*zero\\\\*\\\\* configuration needed. Just choose your task (translation? how about question answering?), upload your data, and let Hugging Face do the rest of the work! By letting AutoTrain experiment with number of different models, there's even a good chance that you'll end up with a model that performs better than a model that's been hand-trained by an engineer ü§Ø We‚Äôve been expanding the number of tasks that we support, and we‚Äôre proud to announce that \\\\*\\\\*you can now use AutoTrain for Computer Vision\\\\*\\\\*!\\n\\nThen it would be easier to analyze a specific feature. We used HuggingFace‚Äôs powerful APIs and AutoTrain along with Kili‚Äôs easy-to-use interface in this example. The modeling with AutoTrain just took 30 minutes, it chose the models and trained them for our use. AutoTrain is definitely much more efficient since I spent more time as I develop the model by myself. All the code, datasets, and scripts can be found in [github](https://github.com/alperiox/review-classification-kili-hf-automl). You can also try the [AutoTrain model](https://huggingface.co/alperiox/autonlp-user-review-classification-536415182). While we can consider this as a valid starting point, we should collect more data and try to build better pipelines. Better pipelines would result in more efficient improvements.\\n\\nOther datasets try to overcome this issue by focusing on specific tasks or domains. For example, the [Howto100M](https://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/howto100m/) dataset consists of 136M video clips with captions that describe how to perform complex tasks such as cooking, handcrafting, gardening, and fitness step-by-step.

There‚Äôs just one problem ‚Äì you don‚Äôt know how to code! üò± Or maybe you‚Äôre a seasoned software engineer who wants to add some ML to your side-project, but you don‚Äôt have the time to pick up a whole new tech stack! For many people, the technical barriers to picking up machine learning feel insurmountable. That‚Äôs why Hugging Face created [AutoTrain](https://huggingface.co/autotrain), and with the latest feature we‚Äôve just added, we‚Äôre making ‚Äúno-code‚Äù machine learning better than ever. Best of all, you can create your first project for ‚ú® free! ‚ú®\\n[Hugging Face AutoTrain](https://huggingface.co/autotrain) lets you train models with \\\\*\\\\*zero\\\\*\\\\* configuration needed. Just choose your task (translation? how about question answering?), upload your data, and let Hugging Face do the rest of the work! By letting AutoTrain experiment with number of different models, there's even a good chance that you'll end up with a model that performs better than a model that's been hand-trained by an engineer ü§Ø We‚Äôve been expanding the number of tasks that we support, and we‚Äôre proud to announce that \\\\*\\\\*you can now use AutoTrain for Computer Vision\\\\*\\\\*!\", 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 14, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.99821293'}}, 'page_content': 'Then it would be easier to analyze a specific feature.

The processing is done in parallel and all setups are synchronized at the end of each training step. 2. \\\\*\\\\*TensorParallel (TP)\\\\*\\\\* - each tensor is split up into multiple chunks, so instead of having the whole tensor reside on a single GPU, each shard of the tensor resides on its designated GPU. During processing each shard gets processed separately and in parallel on different GPUs and the results are synced at the end of the step. This is what one may call horizontal parallelism, as the splitting happens on a horizontal level. 3. \\\\*\\\\*PipelineParallel (PP)\\\\*\\\\* - the model is split up vertically (layer-level) across multiple GPUs, so that only one or several layers of the model are placed on a single GPU. Each GPU processes in parallel different stages of the pipeline and works on a small chunk of the batch. 4. \\\\*\\\\*Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO)\\\\*\\\\* - also performs sharding of the tensors somewhat similar to TP, except the whole tensor gets reconstructed in time for a forward or backward computation, therefore the model doesn\\'t need to be modified.', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': '04257889-fe90-4dcf-bd2c-88caa8069337', 'tool_call_id': 'call_f4VT8s1vl3hNnoMOr32S8sRg', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 19, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.9991356'}}, 'page_content': '--\\ntitle: \"Accelerate Large Model Training using PyTorch Fully Sharded Data Parallel\"\\nthumbnail: /blog/assets/62\\\\_pytorch\\\\_fsdp/fsdp-thumbnail.png\\nauthors:\\n- user: smangrul\\n- user: sgugger\\n---\\n# Accelerate Large Model Training using PyTorch Fully Sharded Data Parallel\\nIn this post we will look at how we can leverage \\\\*\\\\*[Accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate)\\\\*\\\\* Library for training large models which enables users to leverage the latest features of \\\\*\\\\*[PyTorch FullyShardedDataParallel (FSDP)](https://pytorch.org/blog/introducing-pytorch-fully-sharded-data-parallel-api/)\\\\*\\\\*. # Motivation ü§ó\\n\\\\*\\\\*With the ever increasing scale, size and parameters of the Machine Learning (ML) models, ML practitioners are finding it difficult to train or even load such large models on their hardware.\\\\*\\\\* On one hand, it has been found that large models learn quickly (data and compute efficient) and are significantly more performant when compared to smaller models [1]; on the other hand, it becomes prohibitive to train such models on most of the available hardware.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 4, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.99911755'}}, 'page_content': \"This would result in the CPU RAM getting out of memory leading to processes being terminated. 2.

The processing is done in parallel and all setups are synchronized at the end of each training step. 2. \\\\*\\\\*TensorParallel (TP)\\\\*\\\\* - each tensor is split up into multiple chunks, so instead of having the whole tensor reside on a single GPU, each shard of the tensor resides on its designated GPU. During processing each shard gets processed separately and in parallel on different GPUs and the results are synced at the end of the step. This is what one may call horizontal parallelism, as the splitting happens on a horizontal level. 3. \\\\*\\\\*PipelineParallel (PP)\\\\*\\\\* - the model is split up vertically (layer-level) across multiple GPUs, so that only one or several layers of the model are placed on a single GPU. Each GPU processes in parallel different stages of the pipeline and works on a small chunk of the batch. 4. \\\\*\\\\*Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO)\\\\*\\\\* - also performs sharding of the tensors somewhat similar to TP, except the whole tensor gets reconstructed in time for a forward or backward computation, therefore the model doesn't need to be modified.\", 'type': 'Document'}}], 'status': 'success'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'messages', 'AIMessage'], 'kwargs': {'content': \"Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) is designed to address the challenges of training large machine learning models by efficiently distributing the model's parameters across multiple GPUs.

It is a large multi-lingual language model, trained on 2.5TB of filtered CommonCrawl\\ndata. The abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*This paper shows that pretraining multilingual language models at scale leads to significant performance gains for a\\nwide range of cross-lingual transfer tasks. We train a Transformer-based masked language model on one hundred\\nlanguages, using more than two terabytes of filtered CommonCrawl data. Our model, dubbed XLM-R, significantly\\noutperforms multilingual BERT (mBERT) on a variety of cross-lingual benchmarks, including +13.8% average accuracy on\\nXNLI, +12.3% average F1 score on MLQA, and +2.1% average F1 score on NER. XLM-R performs particularly well on\\nlow-resource languages, improving 11.8% in XNLI accuracy for Swahili and 9.2% for Urdu over the previous XLM model. We\\nalso present a detailed empirical evaluation of the key factors that are required to achieve these gains, including the\\ntrade-offs between (1) positive transfer and capacity dilution and (2) the performance of high and low resource\\nlanguages at scale. Finally, we show, for the first time, the possibility of multilingual modeling without sacrificing\\nper-language performance; XLM-Ris very competitive with strong monolingual models on the GLUE and XNLI benchmarks. We\\nwill make XLM-R code, data, and models publicly available.\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [stefan-it](https://huggingface.co/stefan-it). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/examples/xlmr). ## Usage tips\\n- XLM-RoBERTa is a multilingual model trained on 100 different languages. Unlike some XLM multilingual models, it does\\nnot require `lang` tensors to understand which language is used, and should be able to determine the correct\\nlanguage from the input ids.', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': 'ba637618-5117-4dfa-8662-9a48d8f75a83', 'tool_call_id': 'call_Brjb0tLXu3s65f5ThCx3pVkd', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 17, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.99855757'}}, 'page_content': '!--Copyright 2021 The HuggingFace Team.

We train a Transformer-based masked language model on one hundred\\nlanguages, using more than two terabytes of filtered CommonCrawl data. Our model, dubbed XLM-R, significantly\\noutperforms multilingual BERT (mBERT) on a variety of cross-lingual benchmarks, including +13.8% average accuracy on\\nXNLI, +12.3% average F1 score on MLQA, and +2.1% average F1 score on NER. XLM-R performs particularly well on\\nlow-resource languages, improving 11.8% in XNLI accuracy for Swahili and 9.2% for Urdu over the previous XLM model. We\\nalso present a detailed empirical evaluation of the key factors that are required to achieve these gains, including the\\ntrade-offs between (1) positive transfer and capacity dilution and (2) the performance of high and low resource\\nlanguages at scale. Finally, we show, for the first time, the possibility of multilingual modeling without sacrificing\\nper-language performance; XLM-Ris very competitive with strong monolingual models on the GLUE and XNLI benchmarks. We\\nwill make XLM-R code, data, and models publicly available.\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [stefan-it](https://huggingface.co/stefan-it).

The abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*Motivated by the success of T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) in pre-trained natural language processing models, we propose a unified-modal SpeechT5 framework that explores the encoder-decoder pre-training for self-supervised speech/text representation learning. The SpeechT5 framework consists of a shared encoder-decoder network and six modal-specific (speech/text) pre/post-nets. After preprocessing the input speech/text through the pre-nets, the shared encoder-decoder network models the sequence-to-sequence transformation, and then the post-nets generate the output in the speech/text modality based on the output of the decoder. Leveraging large-scale unlabeled speech and text data, we pre-train SpeechT5 to learn a unified-modal representation, hoping to improve the modeling capability for both speech and text. To align the textual and speech information into this unified semantic space, we propose a cross-modal vector quantization approach that randomly mixes up speech/text states with latent units as the interface between encoder and decoder. Extensive evaluations show the superiority of the proposed SpeechT5 framework on a wide variety of spoken language processing tasks, including automatic speech recognition, speech synthesis, speech translation, voice conversion, speech enhancement, and speaker identification.\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [Matthijs](https://huggingface.co/Matthijs).

The original code can be\\nfound [here](https://github.com/google-research/t5x). ## Usage tips\\n- UMT5 was only pre-trained on [mC4](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mc4) excluding any supervised training. Therefore, this model has to be fine-tuned before it is usable on a downstream task, unlike the original T5 model. - Since umT5 was pre-trained in an unsupervise manner, there\\'s no real advantage to using a task prefix during single-task\\nfine-tuning. If you are doing multi-task fine-tuning, you should use a prefix. ## Differences with mT5? `UmT5` is based on mT5, with a non-shared relative positional bias that is computed for each layer. This means that the model set `has\\\\_relative\\\\_bias` for each layer. The conversion script is also different because the model was saved in t5x\\'s latest checkpointing format. # Sample usage\\n```python\\n>>> from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, AutoTokenizer\\n>>> model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from\\\\_pretrained(\"google/umt5-small\")\\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from\\\\_pretrained(\"google/umt5-small\")\\n>>> inputs = tokenizer(\\n... \"A  walks into a bar and orders a  with  pinch of .\",\\n... return\\\\_tensors=\"pt\",\\n... )\\n>>> outputs = model.generate(\\\\*\\\\*inputs)\\n>>> print(tokenizer.batch\\\\_decode(outputs))\\n[\\'nyone who drink a alcohol A A.

The abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*Motivated by the success of T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) in pre-trained natural language processing models, we propose a unified-modal SpeechT5 framework that explores the encoder-decoder pre-training for self-supervised speech/text representation learning. The SpeechT5 framework consists of a shared encoder-decoder network and six modal-specific (speech/text) pre/post-nets. After preprocessing the input speech/text through the pre-nets, the shared encoder-decoder network models the sequence-to-sequence transformation, and then the post-nets generate the output in the speech/text modality based on the output of the decoder. Leveraging large-scale unlabeled speech and text data, we pre-train SpeechT5 to learn a unified-modal representation, hoping to improve the modeling capability for both speech and text. To align the textual and speech information into this unified semantic space, we propose a cross-modal vector quantization approach that randomly mixes up speech/text states with latent units as the interface between encoder and decoder. Extensive evaluations show the superiority of the proposed SpeechT5 framework on a wide variety of spoken language processing tasks, including automatic speech recognition, speech synthesis, speech translation, voice conversion, speech enhancement, and speaker identification.\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [Matthijs](https://huggingface.co/Matthijs).

Therefore, this model has to be fine-tuned before it is usable on a downstream task, unlike the original T5 model. - Since umT5 was pre-trained in an unsupervise manner, there\\'s no real advantage to using a task prefix during single-task\\nfine-tuning. If you are doing multi-task fine-tuning, you should use a prefix. ## Differences with mT5? `UmT5` is based on mT5, with a non-shared relative positional bias that is computed for each layer. This means that the model set `has\\\\_relative\\\\_bias` for each layer. The conversion script is also different because the model was saved in t5x\\'s latest checkpointing format. # Sample usage\\n```python\\n>>> from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, AutoTokenizer\\n>>> model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from\\\\_pretrained(\"google/umt5-small\")\\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from\\\\_pretrained(\"google/umt5-small\")\\n>>> inputs = tokenizer(\\n... \"A  walks into a bar and orders a  with  pinch of .\",\\n... return\\\\_tensors=\"pt\",\\n... )\\n>>> outputs = model.generate(\\\\*\\\\*inputs)\\n>>> print(tokenizer.batch\\\\_decode(outputs))\\n[\\'nyone who drink a alcohol A A.

Word-based tokenization is the idea of splitting the raw text into words, by splitting on spaces or other specific rules like punctuation. In this algorithm, each word has a specific number, an \"ID\", attributed to it. In this example, \"Let\\'s\" has the ID 250, do has ID 861, and tokenization followed by an exclamation point has the ID 345. This approach is interesting, as the model has representations that are based on entire words. The information held in a single number is high as a word contains a lot of contextual and semantic information in a sentence. However, this approach does have its limits. For example, the word dog and the word dogs are very similar, and their meaning is close. However, the word-based tokenization will attribute entirely different IDs to these two words, and the model will therefore learn different meanings for these two words. This is unfortunate, as we would like the model to understand that these words are indeed related and that dogs is the plural form of the word dog.\\n\\nWordPiece tokenization[[wordpiece-tokenization]]\\nWordPiece is the tokenization algorithm Google developed to pretrain BERT. It has since been reused in quite a few Transformer models based on BERT, such as DistilBERT, MobileBERT, Funnel Transformers, and MPNET. It\\'s very similar to BPE in terms of the training, but the actual tokenization is done differently. üí° This section covers WordPiece in depth, going as far as showing a full implementation. You can skip to the end if you just want a general overview of the tokenization algorithm. ## Training algorithm[[training-algorithm]]\\n‚ö†Ô∏è Google never open-sourced its implementation of the training algorithm of WordPiece, so what follows is our best guess based on the published literature. It may not be 100% accurate. Like BPE, WordPiece starts from a small vocabulary including the special tokens used by the model and the initial alphabet. Since it identifies subwords by adding a prefix (like `##` for BERT), each word is initially split by adding that prefix to all the characters inside the word. So, for instance, `\"word\"` gets split like this:\\n```\\nw ##o ##r ##d\\n```\\nThus, the initial alphabet contains all the characters present at the beginning of a word and the characters present inside a word preceded by the WordPiece prefix. Then, again like BPE, WordPiece learns merge rules. The main difference is the way the pair to be merged is selected. Instead of selecting the most frequent pair, WordPiece computes a score for each pair, using the following formula:\\n$$\\\\mathrm{score} = (\\\\mathrm{freq\\\\\\\\_of\\\\\\\\_pair}) / (\\\\mathrm{freq\\\\\\\\_of\\\\\\\\_first\\\\\\\\_element} \\\\times \\\\mathrm{freq\\\\\\\\_of\\\\\\\\_second\\\\\\\\_element})$$\\nBy dividing the frequency of the pair by the product of the frequencies of each of its parts, the algorithm prioritizes the merging of pairs where the individual parts are less frequent in the vocabulary.\\n\\nIn turn, the model will now be able to make sense of token in different situations. It will understand that the words token, tokens, tokenizing, and tokenization are linked and have a similar meaning. It will also understand that tokenization, modernization, and immunization, which all have the same suffixes, are probably used in the same syntactic situations. Subword-based tokenizers generally have a way to identify which tokens are start of words, and which tokens complete start of words: token as the start of a word. ##ization as completing a word. Here the ## prefix indicates that ization is part of a word rather than the beginning of it. The ## comes from the BERT tokenizer, based on the WordPiece algorithm. Other tokenizers use other prefixes, which can be placed to indicate part of words like seen here, or start of words instead!

Word-based tokenization is the idea of splitting the raw text into words, by splitting on spaces or other specific rules like punctuation. In this algorithm, each word has a specific number, an \"ID\", attributed to it. In this example, \"Let\\'s\" has the ID 250, do has ID 861, and tokenization followed by an exclamation point has the ID 345. This approach is interesting, as the model has representations that are based on entire words. The information held in a single number is high as a word contains a lot of contextual and semantic information in a sentence. However, this approach does have its limits. For example, the word dog and the word dogs are very similar, and their meaning is close. However, the word-based tokenization will attribute entirely different IDs to these two words, and the model will therefore learn different meanings for these two words. This is unfortunate, as we would like the model to understand that these words are indeed related and that dogs is the plural form of the word dog.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 12, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.9990315'}}, 'page_content': 'WordPiece tokenization[[wordpiece-tokenization]]\\nWordPiece is the tokenization algorithm Google developed to pretrain BERT. It has since been reused in quite a few Transformer models based on BERT, such as DistilBERT, MobileBERT, Funnel Transformers, and MPNET. It\\'s very similar to BPE in terms of the training, but the actual tokenization is done differently. üí° This section covers WordPiece in depth, going as far as showing a full implementation. You can skip to the end if you just want a general overview of the tokenization algorithm. ## Training algorithm[[training-algorithm]]\\n‚ö†Ô∏è Google never open-sourced its implementation of the training algorithm of WordPiece, so what follows is our best guess based on the published literature. It may not be 100% accurate. Like BPE, WordPiece starts from a small vocabulary including the special tokens used by the model and the initial alphabet. Since it identifies subwords by adding a prefix (like `##` for BERT), each word is initially split by adding that prefix to all the characters inside the word. So, for instance, `\"word\"` gets split like this:\\n```\\nw ##o ##r ##d\\n```\\nThus, the initial alphabet contains all the characters present at the beginning of a word and the characters present inside a word preceded by the WordPiece prefix. Then, again like BPE, WordPiece learns merge rules. The main difference is the way the pair to be merged is selected. Instead of selecting the most frequent pair, WordPiece computes a score for each pair, using the following formula:\\n$$\\\\mathrm{score} = (\\\\mathrm{freq\\\\\\\\_of\\\\\\\\_pair}) / (\\\\mathrm{freq\\\\\\\\_of\\\\\\\\_first\\\\\\\\_element} \\\\times \\\\mathrm{freq\\\\\\\\_of\\\\\\\\_second\\\\\\\\_element})$$\\nBy dividing the frequency of the pair by the product of the frequencies of each of its parts, the algorithm prioritizes the merging of pairs where the individual parts are less frequent in the vocabulary.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 0, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.99856037'}}, 'page_content': 'In turn, the model will now be able to make sense of token in different situations.

If you create a cool callback, contribute it to the repo! ## Flagging with Blocks\\nWhat about if you are using `gradio.Blocks`?

Run like this: `gradio run.py --encoding cp1252`\\nüî• If your application accepts command line arguments, you can pass them in as well. Here\\'s an example:\\n```python\\nimport gradio as gr\\nimport argparse\\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\\nparser.add\\\\_argument(\"--name\", type=str, default=\"User\")\\nargs, unknown = parser.parse\\\\_known\\\\_args()\\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\\ngr.Markdown(f\"# Greetings {args.name}!\")\\ninp = gr.Textbox()\\nout = gr.Textbox()\\ninp.change(fn=lambda x: x, inputs=inp, outputs=out)\\nif \\\\_\\\\_name\\\\_\\\\_ == \"\\\\_\\\\_main\\\\_\\\\_\":\\ndemo.launch()\\n```\\nWhich you could run like this: `gradio run.py --name Gretel`\\nAs a small aside, this auto-reloading happens if you change your `run.py` source code or the Gradio source code.\\n\\nAdvanced Interface features[[advanced-interface-features]]\\nNow that we can build and share a basic interface, let\\'s explore some more advanced features such as state, and interpretation. ### Using state to persist data[[using-state-to-persist-data]]\\nGradio supports \\\\*session state\\\\*, where data persists across multiple submits within a\\npage load. Session state is useful for building demos of, for example, chatbots where you want to\\npersist data as the user interacts with the model. Note that session state does not share data between different users of your model. To store data in a session state, you need to do three things:\\n1. Pass in an \\\\*extra parameter\\\\* into your function, which represents the state of the interface. 1. At the end of the function, return the updated value of the state as an \\\\*extra return value\\\\*. 1. Add the \\'state\\' input and \\'state\\' output components when creating your `Interface`. See the chatbot example below:\\n```py\\nimport random\\nimport gradio as gr\\ndef chat(message, history):\\nhistory = history or []\\nif message.startswith(\"How many\"):\\nresponse = random.randint(1, 10)\\nelif message.startswith(\"How\"):\\nresponse = random.choice([\"Great\", \"Good\", \"Okay\", \"Bad\"])\\nelif message.startswith(\"Where\"):\\nresponse = random.choice([\"Here\", \"There\", \"Somewhere\"])\\nelse:\\nresponse = \"I don\\'t know\"\\nhistory.append((message, response))\\nreturn history, history\\niface = gr.Interface(\\nchat,\\n[\"text\", \"state\"],\\n[\"chatbot\", \"state\"],\\nallow\\\\_screenshot=False,\\nallow\\\\_flagging=\"never\",\\n)\\niface.launch()\\n```\\nNotice how the state of the output component persists across submits.', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': '982ea01f-0941-45e7-9b35-1332a91a7d9f', 'tool_call_id': 'call_2zFst78oge3S4aDvVvfBK4Zz', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 18, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.9990343'}}, 'page_content': 'For example, on Hugging Face\\nSpaces, developers typically don\\'t have access to the underlying ephemeral machine hosting the Gradio\\ndemo.

On one hand, you have even more flexibility\\nwith Blocks -- you can write whatever Python code you want to run when a button is clicked,\\nand assign that using the built-in events in Blocks.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 4, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.99861217'}}, 'page_content': 'By default, the Gradio use UTF-8 encoding for scripts. \\\\*\\\\*For reload mode\\\\*\\\\*, If you are using encoding formats other than UTF-8 (such as cp1252), make sure you\\'ve done like this:\\n1.

The model replaces the self-attention layer in a BERT\\nmodel with a fourier transform which returns only the real parts of the transform. The model is significantly faster\\nthan the BERT model because it has fewer parameters and is more memory efficient. The model achieves about 92-97%\\naccuracy of BERT counterparts on GLUE benchmark, and trains much faster than the BERT model. The abstract from the\\npaper is the following:\\n\\\\*We show that Transformer encoder architectures can be sped up, with limited accuracy costs, by replacing the\\nself-attention sublayers with simple linear transformations that \"mix\" input tokens. These linear mixers, along with\\nstandard nonlinearities in feed-forward layers, prove competent at modeling semantic relationships in several text\\nclassification tasks. Most surprisingly, we find that replacing the self-attention sublayer in a Transformer encoder\\nwith a standard, unparameterized Fourier Transform achieves 92-97% of the accuracy of BERT counterparts on the GLUE\\nbenchmark, but trains 80% faster on GPUs and 70% faster on TPUs at standard 512 input lengths. At longer input lengths,\\nour FNet model is significantly faster: when compared to the \"efficient\" Transformers on the Long Range Arena\\nbenchmark, FNet matches the accuracy of the most accurate models, while outpacing the fastest models across all\\nsequence lengths on GPUs (and across relatively shorter lengths on TPUs). Finally, FNet has a light memory footprint\\nand is particularly efficient at smaller model sizes; for a fixed speed and accuracy budget, small FNet models\\noutperform Transformer counterparts.\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [gchhablani](https://huggingface.co/gchhablani). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/f\\\\_net). ## Usage tips\\nThe model was trained without an attention mask as it is based on Fourier Transform. The model was trained with\\nmaximum sequence length 512 which includes pad tokens. Hence, it is highly recommended to use the same maximum\\nsequence length for fine-tuning and inference. ## Resources\\n- [Text classification task guide](../tasks/sequence\\\\_classification)\\n- [Token classification task guide](../tasks/token\\\\_classification)\\n- [Question answering task guide](../tasks/question\\\\_answering)\\n- [Masked language modeling task guide](../tasks/masked\\\\_language\\\\_modeling)\\n- [Multiple choice task guide](../tasks/multiple\\\\_choice)\\n## FNetConfig\\n[[autodoc]] FNetConfig\\n## FNetTokenizer\\n[[autodoc]] FNetTokenizer\\n- build\\\\_inputs\\\\_with\\\\_special\\\\_tokens\\n- get\\\\_special\\\\_tokens\\\\_mask\\n- create\\\\_token\\\\_type\\\\_ids\\\\_from\\\\_sequences\\n- save\\\\_vocabulary\\n## FNetTokenizerFast\\n[[autodoc]] FNetTokenizerFast\\n## FNetModel\\n[[autodoc]] FNetModel\\n- forward\\n## FNetForPreTraining\\n[[autodoc]] FNetForPreTraining\\n- forward\\n## FNetForMaskedLM\\n[[autodoc]] FNetForMaskedLM\\n- forward\\n## FNetForNextSentencePrediction\\n[[autodoc]] FNetForNextSentencePrediction\\n- forward\\n## FNetForSequenceClassification\\n[[autodoc]] FNetForSequenceClassification\\n- forward\\n## FNetForMultipleChoice\\n[[autodoc]] FNetForMultipleChoice\\n- forward\\n## FNetForTokenClassification\\n[[autodoc]] FNetForTokenClassification\\n- forward\\n## FNetForQuestionAnswering\\n[[autodoc]] FNetForQuestionAnswering\\n- forward\\n\\nThus, directly teaching the model about the English language (and the words we use).

NSP (Next Sentence Prediction) is used to help BERT learn about relationships between sentences by predicting if a given sentence follows the previous sentence or not. \\\\*\\\\*Next Sentence Prediction Example:\\\\*\\\\*\\n1. Paul went shopping. He bought a new shirt. (correct sentence pair)\\n2. Ramona made coffee. Vanilla ice cream cones for sale. (incorrect sentence pair)\\nIn training, 50% correct sentence pairs are mixed in with 50% random sentence pairs to help BERT increase next sentence prediction accuracy. \\\\*\\\\*Fun Fact:\\\\*\\\\* BERT is trained on both MLM (50%) and NSP (50%) at the same time. ### 2.4 Transformers\\nThe Transformer architecture makes it possible to parallelize ML training extremely efficiently. Massive parallelization thus makes it feasible to train BERT on large amounts of data in a relatively short period of time. Transformers use an attention mechanism to observe relationships between words. A concept originally proposed in the popular [2017 Attention Is All You Need](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf) paper sparked the use of Transformers in NLP models all around the world. >Since their introduction in 2017, Transformers have rapidly become the state-of-the-art approach to tackle tasks in many domains such as natural language processing, speech recognition, and computer vision. In short, if you‚Äôre doing deep learning, then you need Transformers! Lewis Tunstall, Hugging Face ML Engineer & [Author of Natural Language Processing with Transformers](https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Language-Processing-Transformers-Applications/dp/1098103246))\\n\\nTimeline of popular Transformer model releases:\\n\\n[Source](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/4)\\n\\n#### 2.4.1 How do Transformers work?\\n\\nIt presents two parameter-reduction techniques to lower memory consumption and increase the training\\nspeed of BERT:\\n- Splitting the embedding matrix into two smaller matrices. - Using repeating layers split among groups. The abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*Increasing model size when pretraining natural language representations often results in improved performance on\\ndownstream tasks. However, at some point further model increases become harder due to GPU/TPU memory limitations,\\nlonger training times, and unexpected model degradation. To address these problems, we present two parameter-reduction\\ntechniques to lower memory consumption and increase the training speed of BERT. Comprehensive empirical evidence shows\\nthat our proposed methods lead to models that scale much better compared to the original BERT. We also use a\\nself-supervised loss that focuses on modeling inter-sentence coherence, and show it consistently helps downstream tasks\\nwith multi-sentence inputs. As a result, our best model establishes new state-of-the-art results on the GLUE, RACE, and\\nSQuAD benchmarks while having fewer parameters compared to BERT-large.\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [lysandre](https://huggingface.co/lysandre). This model jax version was contributed by\\n[kamalkraj](https://huggingface.co/kamalkraj). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/ALBERT). ## Usage tips\\n- ALBERT is a model with absolute position embeddings so it\\'s usually advised to pad the inputs on the right rather\\nthan the left. - ALBERT uses repeating layers which results in a small memory footprint, however the computational cost remains\\nsimilar to a BERT-like architecture with the same number of hidden layers as it has to iterate through the same\\nnumber of (repeating) layers. - Embedding size E is different from hidden size H justified because the embeddings are context independent (one embedding vector represents one token), whereas hidden states are context dependent (one hidden state represents a sequence of tokens) so it\\'s more logical to have H >> E. Also, the embedding matrix is large since it\\'s V x E (V being the vocab size). If E < H, it has less parameters. - Layers are split in groups that share parameters (to save memory). Next sentence prediction is replaced by a sentence ordering prediction: in the inputs, we have two sentences A and B (that are consecutive) and we either feed A followed by B or B followed by A.', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': 'c57a789c-5177-4d28-b676-3331e7b7e2de', 'tool_call_id': 'call_ssubjVrldvxahoRLwYqHODVl', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 0, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.99848324'}}, 'page_content': '!--Copyright 2021 The HuggingFace Team.

Hence, it is highly recommended to use the same maximum\\nsequence length for fine-tuning and inference. ## Resources\\n- [Text classification task guide](../tasks/sequence\\\\_classification)\\n- [Token classification task guide](../tasks/token\\\\_classification)\\n- [Question answering task guide](../tasks/question\\\\_answering)\\n- [Masked language modeling task guide](../tasks/masked\\\\_language\\\\_modeling)\\n- [Multiple choice task guide](../tasks/multiple\\\\_choice)\\n## FNetConfig\\n[[autodoc]] FNetConfig\\n## FNetTokenizer\\n[[autodoc]] FNetTokenizer\\n- build\\\\_inputs\\\\_with\\\\_special\\\\_tokens\\n- get\\\\_special\\\\_tokens\\\\_mask\\n- create\\\\_token\\\\_type\\\\_ids\\\\_from\\\\_sequences\\n- save\\\\_vocabulary\\n## FNetTokenizerFast\\n[[autodoc]] FNetTokenizerFast\\n## FNetModel\\n[[autodoc]] FNetModel\\n- forward\\n## FNetForPreTraining\\n[[autodoc]] FNetForPreTraining\\n- forward\\n## FNetForMaskedLM\\n[[autodoc]] FNetForMaskedLM\\n- forward\\n## FNetForNextSentencePrediction\\n[[autodoc]] FNetForNextSentencePrediction\\n- forward\\n## FNetForSequenceClassification\\n[[autodoc]] FNetForSequenceClassification\\n- forward\\n## FNetForMultipleChoice\\n[[autodoc]] FNetForMultipleChoice\\n- forward\\n## FNetForTokenClassification\\n[[autodoc]] FNetForTokenClassification\\n- forward\\n## FNetForQuestionAnswering\\n[[autodoc]] FNetForQuestionAnswering\\n- forward', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 12, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.9979856'}}, 'page_content': 'Thus, directly teaching the model about the English language (and the words we use).

NSP (Next Sentence Prediction) is used to help BERT learn about relationships between sentences by predicting if a given sentence follows the previous sentence or not. \\\\*\\\\*Next Sentence Prediction Example:\\\\*\\\\*\\n1. Paul went shopping. He bought a new shirt. (correct sentence pair)\\n2. Ramona made coffee. Vanilla ice cream cones for sale. (incorrect sentence pair)\\nIn training, 50% correct sentence pairs are mixed in with 50% random sentence pairs to help BERT increase next sentence prediction accuracy. \\\\*\\\\*Fun Fact:\\\\*\\\\* BERT is trained on both MLM (50%) and NSP (50%) at the same time. ### 2.4 Transformers\\nThe Transformer architecture makes it possible to parallelize ML training extremely efficiently. Massive parallelization thus makes it feasible to train BERT on large amounts of data in a relatively short period of time. Transformers use an attention mechanism to observe relationships between words. A concept originally proposed in the popular [2017 Attention Is All You Need](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf) paper sparked the use of Transformers in NLP models all around the world. >Since their introduction in 2017, Transformers have rapidly become the state-of-the-art approach to tackle tasks in many domains such as natural language processing, speech recognition, and computer vision. In short, if you‚Äôre doing deep learning, then you need Transformers! Lewis Tunstall, Hugging Face ML Engineer & [Author of Natural Language Processing with Transformers](https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Language-Processing-Transformers-Applications/dp/1098103246))\\n\\nTimeline of popular Transformer model releases:\\n\\n[Source](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/4)\\n\\n#### 2.4.1 How do Transformers work?', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 15, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.9974163'}}, 'page_content': \"It presents two parameter-reduction techniques to lower memory consumption and increase the training\\nspeed of BERT:\\n- Splitting the embedding matrix into two smaller matrices. - Using repeating layers split among groups. The abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*Increasing model size when pretraining natural language representations often results in improved performance on\\ndownstream tasks. However, at some point further model increases become harder due to GPU/TPU memory limitations,\\nlonger training times, and unexpected model degradation. To address these problems, we present two parameter-reduction\\ntechniques to lower memory consumption and increase the training speed of BERT. Comprehensive empirical evidence shows\\nthat our proposed methods lead to models that scale much better compared to the original BERT. We also use a\\nself-supervised loss that focuses on modeling inter-sentence coherence, and show it consistently helps downstream tasks\\nwith multi-sentence inputs. As a result, our best model establishes new state-of-the-art results on the GLUE, RACE, and\\nSQuAD benchmarks while having fewer parameters compared to BERT-large.\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [lysandre](https://huggingface.co/lysandre). This model jax version was contributed by\\n[kamalkraj](https://huggingface.co/kamalkraj). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/ALBERT). ## Usage tips\\n- ALBERT is a model with absolute position embeddings so it's usually advised to pad the inputs on the right rather\\nthan the left. - ALBERT uses repeating layers which results in a small memory footprint, however the computational cost remains\\nsimilar to a BERT-like architecture with the same number of hidden layers as it has to iterate through the same\\nnumber of (repeating) layers. - Embedding size E is different from hidden size H justified because the embeddings are context independent (one embedding vector represents one token), whereas hidden states are context dependent (one hidden state represents a sequence of tokens) so it's more logical to have H >> E. Also, the embedding matrix is large since it's V x E (V being the vocab size). If E < H, it has less parameters. - Layers are split in groups that share parameters (to save memory). Next sentence prediction is replaced by a sentence ordering prediction: in the inputs, we have two sentences A and B (that are consecutive) and we either feed A followed by B or B followed by A.\", 'type': 'Document'}}], 'status': 'success'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'messages', 'AIMessage'], 'kwargs': {'content': 'The FNet model replaces the self-attention layer in a BERT model with a Fourier transform that returns only the real parts of the transform.', 'response_metadata': {'finish_reason': 'stop', 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_34a54ae93c'}, 'type': 'ai', 'id': 'run--8305f8e7-56db-4002-857c-978a9aa11099-0', 'usage_metadata': {'input_tokens': 2325, 'output_tokens': 29, 'total_tokens': 2354, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}, 'tool_calls': [], 'invalid_tool_calls': []}}], 'chat_history': []}\n"

This framework obviously adds some time overhead because of the extra preprocessing and conversion steps. So it is important that you decide which framework is more appropriate for your case and model size. We recommend trying it for pre-training models or extended fine-tuning, but probably not for shorter fine-tuning of medium-sized models. The `Trainer` API and `accelerate` library are also very handy for model training, they are device-agnostic and give significant flexibility to the users. Congratulations üéâ now you know how to train a GPT2 model in Megatron-LM and make it supported by `transformers`!\\n\\nOf course, we would need to evaluate the model more thoroughly before deploying it in the real world, but this is still an impressive prototype. {:else}\\nLooking at these few examples, it seems that the model has learned some of the syntax of the Python data science stack (of course, we would need to evaluate it more thoroughly before deploying the model in the real world). Sometimes it requires more customization of the model training to achieve the necessary performance for a given use case, however. For example, what if we would like to dynamically update the batch size or have a conditional training loop that skips bad examples on the fly? One option would be to subclass the `Trainer` and add the necessary changes, but sometimes it's simpler to write the training loop from scratch. That's where ü§ó Accelerate comes in. {/if}\\n{#if fw === 'pt'}\\n## Training with ü§ó Accelerate[[training-with-accelerate]]\\nWe've seen how to train a model with the `Trainer`, which can allow for some customization. However, sometimes we want full control over the training loop, or we want to make some exotic changes. In this case ü§ó Accelerate is a great choice, and in this section we'll go through the steps to use it to train our model.

In this video, we will look at what actually happens when we use the pipeline function of the Transformers library. More specifically, we will look at the sentiment analysis pipeline, and how it went from the two following sentences to the positive labels with their respective scores. As we have seen in the pipeline presentation, there are three stages in the pipeline. First, we convert the raw texts to numbers the model can make sense of, using a tokenizer. Then, those numbers go through the model, which outputs logits. Finally, the post-processing steps transforms those logits into labels and scores. Let\\'s look in detail at those three steps, and how to replicate them using the Transformers library, beginning with the first stage, tokenization. The tokenization process has several steps. First, the text is split into small chunks called tokens. They can be words, parts of words or punctuation symbols. Then the tokenizer will had some special tokens (if the model expect them). Here the model uses expects a CLS token at the beginning and a SEP token at the end of the sentence to classify. Lastly, the tokenizer matches each token to its unique ID in the vocabulary of the pretrained model. To load such a tokenizer, the Transformers library provides the AutoTokenizer API. The most important method of this class is from\\\\_pretrained, which will download and cache the configuration and the vocabulary associated to a given checkpoint. Here, the checkpoint used by default for the sentiment analysis pipeline is distilbert base uncased finetuned sst2 english. We instantiate a tokenizer associated with that checkpoint, then feed it the two sentences. Since those two sentences are not of the same size, we will need to pad the shortest one to be able to build an array. This is done by the tokenizer with the option padding=True. With truncation=True, we ensure that any sentence longer than the maximum the model can handle is truncated. Lastly, the return\\\\_tensors option tells the tokenizer to return a PyTorch tensor.\\n\\nFrameworkSwitchCourse {fw} />\\n# Tokenizers[[tokenizers]]\\n{#if fw === \\'pt\\'}\\n{:else}\\n{/if}\\nTokenizers are one of the core components of the NLP pipeline.

Up until now, searching on the Hub through this interface was tricky to pull off, and there were many aspects of it a user had to \"just know\" and get accustomed to. In this article, we will be looking at a few exciting new features added to `huggingface\\\\_hub` to help lower that bar and provide users with a friendly API to search for the models and datasets they want to use without leaving their Jupyter or Python interfaces. > Before we begin, if you do not have the latest version of the `huggingface\\\\_hub` library on your system, please run the following cell:\\n```python\\n!pip install huggingface\\\\_hub -U\\n```\\n## Situating the Problem:\\nFirst, let\\'s imagine the scenario you are in. You\\'d like to find all models hosted on the Hugging Face Hub for Text Classification, were trained on the GLUE dataset, and are compatible with PyTorch.\\n\\nUsing AllenNLP at Hugging Face\\n`allennlp` is a NLP library for developing state-of-the-art models on different linguistic tasks. It provides high-level abstractions and APIs for common components and models in modern NLP. It also provides an extensible framework that makes it easy to run and manage NLP experiments. ## Exploring allennlp in the Hub\\nYou can find `allennlp` models on the Hub by filtering at the left of the [models page](https://huggingface.co/models?library=allennlp). All models on the Hub come up with useful features\\n1. A training metrics tab with automatically hosted TensorBoard traces. 2. Metadata tags that help for discoverability. 3. An interactive widget you can use to play out with the model directly in the browser. 4. An Inference API that allows to make inference requests. ![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/libraries-allennlp_widget.png)\\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/libraries-allennlp_widget-dark.png)\\n\\n## Using existing models\\nYou can use the `Predictor` class to load existing models on the Hub. To achieve this, use the `from\\\\_path` method and use the `\"hf://\"` prefix with the repository id. Here is an end-to-end example. ```py\\nimport allennlp\\\\_models\\nfrom allennlp.predictors.predictor import Predictor\\npredictor = Predictor.from\\\\_path(\"hf://allenai/bidaf-elmo\")\\npredictor\\\\_input = {\\n\"passage\": \"My name is Wolfgang and I live in Berlin\",\\n\"question\": \"Where do I live?\"\\n}\\npredictions = predictor.predict\\\\_json(predictor\\\\_input)\\n```\\nTo get a snippet such as this, you can click `Use in AllenNLP` at the top right,\\n\\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/libraries-allennlp_snippet.png)\\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/libraries-allennlp_snippet-dark.png)\\n\\n## Sharing your models\\nThe first step is to save the model locally.\\n\\n--\\ntitle: \"Introducing Skops\"\\nthumbnail: /blog/assets/94\\\\_skops/introducing\\\\_skops.png\\nauthors:\\n- user: merve\\n- user: adrin\\n- user: BenjaminB\\n---\\n# Introducing Skops\\n## Introducing Skops\\nAt Hugging Face, we are working on tackling various problems in open-source machine learning, including, hosting models securely and openly, enabling reproducibility, explainability and collaboration.

In this article, we will be looking at a few exciting new features added to `huggingface\\\\_hub` to help lower that bar and provide users with a friendly API to search for the models and datasets they want to use without leaving their Jupyter or Python interfaces. > Before we begin, if you do not have the latest version of the `huggingface\\\\_hub` library on your system, please run the following cell:\\n```python\\n!pip install huggingface\\\\_hub -U\\n```\\n## Situating the Problem:\\nFirst, let\\'s imagine the scenario you are in.

It provides high-level abstractions and APIs for common components and models in modern NLP. It also provides an extensible framework that makes it easy to run and manage NLP experiments. ## Exploring allennlp in the Hub\\nYou can find `allennlp` models on the Hub by filtering at the left of the [models page](https://huggingface.co/models?library=allennlp). All models on the Hub come up with useful features\\n1. A training metrics tab with automatically hosted TensorBoard traces. 2. Metadata tags that help for discoverability. 3. An interactive widget you can use to play out with the model directly in the browser. 4. An Inference API that allows to make inference requests. ![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/libraries-allennlp_widget.png)\\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/libraries-allennlp_widget-dark.png)\\n\\n## Using existing models\\nYou can use the `Predictor` class to load existing models on the Hub.

Both parts of the diagram show parallelism that is of degree 4. That is 4 GPUs are participating in the pipeline. So there is the forward path of 4 pipe stages F0, F1, F2 and F3 and then the return reverse order backward path of B3, B2, B1 and B0. PP introduces a new hyper-parameter to tune that is called `chunks`. It defines how many chunks of data are sent in a sequence through the same pipe stage. For example, in the bottom diagram, you can see that `chunks=4`. GPU0 performs the same forward path on chunk 0, 1, 2 and 3 (F0,0, F0,1, F0,2, F0,3) and then it waits for other GPUs to do their work and only when their work is starting to be complete, does GPU0 start to work again doing the backward path for chunks 3, 2, 1 and 0 (B0,3, B0,2, B0,1, B0,0). Note that conceptually this is the same concept as gradient accumulation steps (GAS). PyTorch uses `chunks`, whereas DeepSpeed refers to the same hyper-parameter as GAS. Because of the chunks, PP introduces the concept of micro-batches (MBS). DP splits the global data batch size into mini-batches, so if you have a DP degree of 4, a global batch size of 1024 gets split up into 4 mini-batches of 256 each (1024/4). And if the number of `chunks` (or GAS) is 32 we end up with a micro-batch size of 8 (256/32). Each Pipeline stage works with a single micro-batch at a time. To calculate the global batch size of the DP + PP setup we then do: `mbs\\\\*chunks\\\\*dp\\\\_degree` (`8\\\\*32\\\\*4=1024`).\\n\\nGPU experiments are ran without further optimizations besides JAX\\ntransformations.

Both parts of the diagram show parallelism that is of degree 4. That is 4 GPUs are participating in the pipeline. So there is the forward path of 4 pipe stages F0, F1, F2 and F3 and then the return reverse order backward path of B3, B2, B1 and B0. PP introduces a new hyper-parameter to tune that is called `chunks`. It defines how many chunks of data are sent in a sequence through the same pipe stage. For example, in the bottom diagram, you can see that `chunks=4`. GPU0 performs the same forward path on chunk 0, 1, 2 and 3 (F0,0, F0,1, F0,2, F0,3) and then it waits for other GPUs to do their work and only when their work is starting to be complete, does GPU0 start to work again doing the backward path for chunks 3, 2, 1 and 0 (B0,3, B0,2, B0,1, B0,0). Note that conceptually this is the same concept as gradient accumulation steps (GAS). PyTorch uses `chunks`, whereas DeepSpeed refers to the same hyper-parameter as GAS. Because of the chunks, PP introduces the concept of micro-batches (MBS). DP splits the global data batch size into mini-batches, so if you have a DP degree of 4, a global batch size of 1024 gets split up into 4 mini-batches of 256 each (1024/4). And if the number of `chunks` (or GAS) is 32 we end up with a micro-batch size of 8 (256/32). Each Pipeline stage works with a single micro-batch at a time. To calculate the global batch size of the DP + PP setup we then do: `mbs\\\\*chunks\\\\*dp\\\\_degree` (`8\\\\*32\\\\*4=1024`).', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 9, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.99925'}}, 'page_content': 'GPU experiments are ran without further optimizations besides JAX\\ntransformations.

Make sure to [read the Guide to Blocks first](https://gradio.app/guides/quickstart/#blocks-more-flexibility-and-control). This guide covers auto reloading, reloading in a Python IDE, and using gradio with Jupyter Notebooks. ## Why Auto-Reloading? When you are building a Gradio demo, particularly out of Blocks, you may find it cumbersome to keep re-running your code to test your changes. To make it faster and more convenient to write your code, we\\'ve made it easier to \"reload\" your Gradio apps instantly when you are developing in a \\\\*\\\\*Python IDE\\\\*\\\\* (like VS Code, Sublime Text, PyCharm, or so on) or generally running your Python code from the terminal. We\\'ve also developed an analogous \"magic command\" that allows you to re-run cells faster if you use \\\\*\\\\*Jupyter Notebooks\\\\*\\\\* (or any similar environment like Colab). This short Guide will cover both of these methods, so no matter how you write Python, you\\'ll leave knowing how to build Gradio apps faster. ## Python IDE Reload üî•\\nIf you are building Gradio Blocks using a Python IDE, your file of code (let\\'s name it `run.py`) might look something like this:\\n```python\\nimport gradio as gr\\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\\ngr.Markdown(\"# Greetings from Gradio!\")\\ninp = gr.Textbox(placeholder=\"What is your name?\")\\nout = gr.Textbox()\\ninp.change(fn=lambda x: f\"Welcome, {x}!\",\\ninputs=inp,\\noutputs=out)\\nif \\\\_\\\\_name\\\\_\\\\_ == \"\\\\_\\\\_main\\\\_\\\\_\":\\ndemo.launch()\\n```\\nThe problem is that anytime that you want to make a change to your layout, events, or components, you have to close and rerun your app by writing `python run.py`.\\n\\nThis means you\\'ll see your changes \\\\_much, much faster\\\\_ than if you were rerunning the cell normally. Here\\'s what it looks like in a jupyter notebook:\\n![](https://gradio-builds.s3.amazonaws.com/demo-files/jupyter\\\\_reload.gif)\\nü™Ñ This works in colab notebooks too! [Here\\'s a colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zAuWoiTIb3O2oitbtVb2\\\\_ekv1K6ggtC1?usp=sharing) where you can see the Blocks magic in action.

Make sure to [read the Guide to Blocks first](https://gradio.app/guides/quickstart/#blocks-more-flexibility-and-control). This guide covers auto reloading, reloading in a Python IDE, and using gradio with Jupyter Notebooks. ## Why Auto-Reloading? When you are building a Gradio demo, particularly out of Blocks, you may find it cumbersome to keep re-running your code to test your changes. To make it faster and more convenient to write your code, we\\'ve made it easier to \"reload\" your Gradio apps instantly when you are developing in a \\\\*\\\\*Python IDE\\\\*\\\\* (like VS Code, Sublime Text, PyCharm, or so on) or generally running your Python code from the terminal. We\\'ve also developed an analogous \"magic command\" that allows you to re-run cells faster if you use \\\\*\\\\*Jupyter Notebooks\\\\*\\\\* (or any similar environment like Colab). This short Guide will cover both of these methods, so no matter how you write Python, you\\'ll leave knowing how to build Gradio apps faster. ## Python IDE Reload üî•\\nIf you are building Gradio Blocks using a Python IDE, your file of code (let\\'s name it `run.py`) might look something like this:\\n```python\\nimport gradio as gr\\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\\ngr.Markdown(\"# Greetings from Gradio!\")\\ninp = gr.Textbox(placeholder=\"What is your name?\")\\nout = gr.Textbox()\\ninp.change(fn=lambda x: f\"Welcome, {x}!\",\\ninputs=inp,\\noutputs=out)\\nif \\\\_\\\\_name\\\\_\\\\_ == \"\\\\_\\\\_main\\\\_\\\\_\":\\ndemo.launch()\\n```\\nThe problem is that anytime that you want to make a change to your layout, events, or components, you have to close and rerun your app by writing `python run.py`.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 8, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.99839896'}}, 'page_content': \"This means you'll see your changes \\\\_much, much faster\\\\_ than if you were rerunning the cell normally.

The Hugging Face Datasets library is a library that provides an API to quickly download many public datasets and preprocess them. In this video we will explore how to do that. The downloading part is easy: with the load\\\\_dataset function, you can directly download and cache a dataset from its identifier on the Dataset hub. Here we fetch the MRPC dataset from the GLUE benchmark, which is a dataset containing pairs of sentences where the task is to determine the paraphrases. The object returned by the load\\\\_dataset function is a DatasetDict, which is a sort of dictionary containing each split of our dataset. We can access each split by indexing with its name. This split is then an instance of the Dataset class, with columns (here sentence1, sentence2. label and idx) and rows. We can access a given element by its index. The amazing thing about the Hugging Face Datasets library is that everything is saved to disk using Apache Arrow, which means that even if your dataset is huge you won\\'t get out of RAM: only the elements you request are loaded in memory.\\n\\nHugging Face Inference Endpoints documentation\\n## Setup\\n```bash\\npip install hf-doc-builder==0.4.0 watchdog --upgrade\\n```\\n## Local Development\\n```bash\\ndoc-builder preview endpoints docs/source/ --not\\\\_python\\\\_module\\n```\\n## Build Docs\\n```bash\\ndoc-builder build endpoints docs/source/ --build\\\\_dir build/ --not\\\\_python\\\\_module\\n```\\n## Add assets/Images\\nAdding images/assets is only possible through `https://` links meaning you need to use `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/hf-endpoints-documentation/main/assets/` prefix. example\\n```bash\\n![Login](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/hf-endpoints-documentation/main/assets/0_login.png)\\n```\\n## Generate API Reference\\n1.

In this video, we will look at what actually happens when we use the pipeline function of the Transformers library. More specifically, we will look at the sentiment analysis pipeline, and how it went from the two following sentences to the positive labels with their respective scores. As we have seen in the pipeline presentation, there are three stages in the pipeline. First, we convert the raw texts to numbers the model can make sense of, using a tokenizer. Then, those numbers go through the model, which outputs logits. Finally, the post-processing steps transforms those logits into labels and scores. Let's look in detail at those three steps, and how to replicate them using the Transformers library, beginning with the first stage, tokenization. The tokenization process has several steps. First, the text is split into small chunks called tokens. They can be words, parts of words or punctuation symbols. Then the tokenizer will had some special tokens (if the model expect them). Here the model uses expects a CLS token at the beginning and a SEP token at the end of the sentence to classify. Lastly, the tokenizer matches each token to its unique ID in the vocabulary of the pretrained model. To load such a tokenizer, the Transformers library provides the AutoTokenizer API. The most important method of this class is from\\\\_pretrained, which will download and cache the configuration and the vocabulary associated to a given checkpoint. Here, the checkpoint used by default for the sentiment analysis pipeline is distilbert base uncased finetuned sst2 english. We instantiate a tokenizer associated with that checkpoint, then feed it the two sentences. Since those two sentences are not of the same size, we will need to pad the shortest one to be able to build an array. This is done by the tokenizer with the option padding=True. With truncation=True, we ensure that any sentence longer than the maximum the model can handle is truncated.

For multi-GPU training it requires DDP (`torch.distributed.launch`). This feature can be used with any `nn.Module`-based model. If you start getting `loss=NaN` or the model inhibits some other abnormal behavior due to `inf` or `nan` in\\nactivations or weights one needs to discover where the first underflow or overflow happens and what led to it. Luckily\\nyou can accomplish that easily by activating a special module that will do the detection automatically. If you\\'re using [`Trainer`], you just need to add:\\n```bash\\n--debug underflow\\\\_overflow\\n```\\nto the normal command line arguments, or pass `debug=\"underflow\\\\_overflow\"` when creating the\\n[`TrainingArguments`] object. If you\\'re using your own training loop or another Trainer you can accomplish the same with:\\n```python\\nfrom transformers.debug\\\\_utils import DebugUnderflowOverflow\\ndebug\\\\_overflow = DebugUnderflowOverflow(model)\\n```\\n[`~debug\\\\_utils.DebugUnderflowOverflow`] inserts hooks into the model that immediately after each\\nforward call will test input and output variables and also the corresponding module\\'s weights. As soon as `inf` or\\n`nan` is detected in at least one element of the activations or weights, the program will assert and print a report\\nlike this (this was caught with `google/mt5-small` under fp16 mixed precision):\\n```\\nDetected inf/nan during batch\\\\_number=0\\nLast 21 forward frames:\\nabs min abs max metadata\\nencoder.block.1.layer.1.DenseReluDense.dropout Dropout\\n0.00e+00 2.57e+02 input[0]\\n0.00e+00 2.85e+02 output\\n[...]\\nencoder.block.2.layer.0 T5LayerSelfAttention\\n6.78e-04 3.15e+03 input[0]\\n2.65e-04 3.42e+03 output[0]\\nNone output[1]\\n2.25e-01 1.00e+04 output[2]\\nencoder.block.2.layer.1.layer\\\\_norm T5LayerNorm\\n8.69e-02 4.18e-01 weight\\n2.65e-04 3.42e+03 input[0]\\n1.79e-06 4.65e+00 output\\nencoder.block.2.layer.1.DenseReluDense.wi\\\\_0 Linear\\n2.17e-07 4.50e+00 weight\\n1.79e-06 4.65e+00 input[0]\\n2.68e-06 3.70e+01 output\\nencoder.block.2.layer.1.DenseReluDense.wi\\\\_1 Linear\\n8.08e-07 2.66e+01 weight\\n1.79e-06 4.65e+00 input[0]\\n1.27e-04 2.37e+02 output\\nencoder.block.2.layer.1.DenseReluDense.dropout Dropout\\n0.00e+00 8.76e+03 input[0]\\n0.00e+00 9.74e+03 output\\nencoder.block.2.layer.1.DenseReluDense.wo Linear\\n1.01e-06 6.44e+00 weight\\n0.00e+00 9.74e+03 input[0]\\n3.18e-04 6.27e+04 output\\nencoder.block.2.layer.1.DenseReluDense T5DenseGatedGeluDense\\n1.79e-06 4.65e+00 input[0]\\n3.18e-04 6.27e+04 output\\nencoder.block.2.layer.1.dropout Dropout\\n3.18e-04 6.27e+04 input[0]\\n0.00e+00 inf output\\n```\\nThe example output has been trimmed in the middle for brevity.\\n\\n\\\\* correct / len(test\\\\_loader.dataset)}\\')\\n```\\nTypically from here, one could either throw all of this into a python script or run it on a Jupyter Notebook. However, how would you then get this script to run on say two GPUs or on multiple machines if these resources are available, which could improve training speed through \\\\*distributed\\\\* training? Just doing `python myscript.py` will only ever run the script using a single GPU. This is where `torch.distributed` comes into play\\n## PyTorch Distributed Data Parallelism\\nAs the name implies, `torch.distributed` is meant to work on \\\\*distributed\\\\* setups. This can include multi-node, where you have a number of machines each with a single GPU, or multi-gpu where a single system has multiple GPUs, or some combination of both. To convert our above code to work within a distributed setup, a few setup configurations must first be defined, detailed in the [Getting Started with DDP Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp\\\\_tutorial.html)\\nFirst a `setup` and a `cleanup` function must be declared. This will open up a processing group that all of the compute processes can communicate through\\n> Note: for this section of the tutorial it should be assumed these are sent in python script files. Later on a launcher using Accelerate will be discussed that removes this necessity\\n```python\\nimport os\\nimport torch.distributed as dist\\ndef setup(rank, world\\\\_size):\\n\"Sets up the process group and configuration for PyTorch Distributed Data Parallelism\"\\nos.environ[\"MASTER\\\\_ADDR\"] = \\'localhost\\'\\nos.environ[\"MASTER\\\\_PORT\"] = \"12355\"\\n# Initialize the process group\\ndist.init\\\\_process\\\\_group(\"gloo\", rank=rank, world\\\\_size=world\\\\_size)\\ndef cleanup():\\n\"Cleans up the distributed environment\"\\ndist.destroy\\\\_process\\\\_group()\\n```\\nThe last piece of the puzzle is \\\\*how do I send my data and model to another GPU?\\\\*\\nThis is where the `DistributedDataParallel` module comes into play. It will copy your model onto each GPU, and when `loss.backward()` is called the backpropagation is performed and the resulting gradients across all these copies of the model will be averaged/reduced. This ensures each device has the same weights post the optimizer step. Below is an example of our training setup, refactored as a function, with this capability:\\n> Note: Here rank is the overall rank of the current GPU compared to all the other GPUs available, meaning they have a rank of `0 -> n-1`\\n```python\\nfrom torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel as DDP\\ndef train(model, rank, world\\\\_size):\\nsetup(rank, world\\\\_size)\\nmodel = model.to(rank)\\nddp\\\\_model = DDP(model, device\\\\_ids=[rank])\\noptimizer = optim.AdamW(ddp\\\\_model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)\\n# Train for one epoch\\nmodel.train()\\nfor batch\\\\_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(train\\\\_loader):\\ndata, target = data.to(device), target.to(device)\\noutput = model(data)\\nloss = F.nll\\\\_loss(output, target)\\nloss.backward()\\noptimizer.step()\\noptimizer.zero\\\\_grad()\\ncleanup()\\n```\\nThe optimizer needs to be declared based on the model \\\\*on the specific device\\\\* (so `ddp\\\\_model` and not `model`) for all of the gradients to properly be calculated. Lastly, to run the script PyTorch has a convenient `torchrun` command line module that can help. Just pass in the number of nodes it should use as well as the script to run and you are set:\\n```bash\\ntorchrun --nproc\\\\_per\\\\_node=2 --nnodes=1 example\\\\_script.py\\n```\\nThe above will run the training script on two GPUs that live on a single machine and this is the barebones for performing only distributed training with PyTorch.\\n\\nWhen you will face a real project that will be running for hours and perhaps days, definitely spend more time to make sure you use the most optimal hyper-parameters to get your job done faster and at a minimal cost.

If you\\'re using [`Trainer`], you just need to add:\\n```bash\\n--debug underflow\\\\_overflow\\n```\\nto the normal command line arguments, or pass `debug=\"underflow\\\\_overflow\"` when creating the\\n[`TrainingArguments`] object. If you\\'re using your own training loop or another Trainer you can accomplish the same with:\\n```python\\nfrom transformers.debug\\\\_utils import DebugUnderflowOverflow\\ndebug\\\\_overflow = DebugUnderflowOverflow(model)\\n```\\n[`~debug\\\\_utils.DebugUnderflowOverflow`] inserts hooks into the model that immediately after each\\nforward call will test input and output variables and also the corresponding module\\'s weights. As soon as `inf` or\\n`nan` is detected in at least one element of the activations or weights, the program will assert and print a report\\nlike this (this was caught with `google/mt5-small` under fp16 mixed precision):\\n```\\nDetected inf/nan during batch\\\\_number=0\\nLast 21 forward frames:\\nabs min abs max metadata\\nencoder.block.1.layer.1.DenseReluDense.dropout Dropout\\n0.00e+00 2.57e+02 input[0]\\n0.00e+00 2.85e+02 output\\n[...]\\nencoder.block.2.layer.0 T5LayerSelfAttention\\n6.78e-04 3.15e+03 input[0]\\n2.65e-04 3.42e+03 output[0]\\nNone output[1]\\n2.25e-01 1.00e+04 output[2]\\nencoder.block.2.layer.1.layer\\\\_norm T5LayerNorm\\n8.69e-02 4.18e-01 weight\\n2.65e-04 3.42e+03 input[0]\\n1.79e-06 4.65e+00 output\\nencoder.block.2.layer.1.DenseReluDense.wi\\\\_0 Linear\\n2.17e-07 4.50e+00 weight\\n1.79e-06 4.65e+00 input[0]\\n2.68e-06 3.70e+01 output\\nencoder.block.2.layer.1.DenseReluDense.wi\\\\_1 Linear\\n8.08e-07 2.66e+01 weight\\n1.79e-06 4.65e+00 input[0]\\n1.27e-04 2.37e+02 output\\nencoder.block.2.layer.1.DenseReluDense.dropout Dropout\\n0.00e+00 8.76e+03 input[0]\\n0.00e+00 9.74e+03 output\\nencoder.block.2.layer.1.DenseReluDense.wo Linear\\n1.01e-06 6.44e+00 weight\\n0.00e+00 9.74e+03 input[0]\\n3.18e-04 6.27e+04 output\\nencoder.block.2.layer.1.DenseReluDense T5DenseGatedGeluDense\\n1.79e-06 4.65e+00 input[0]\\n3.18e-04 6.27e+04 output\\nencoder.block.2.layer.1.dropout Dropout\\n3.18e-04 6.27e+04 input[0]\\n0.00e+00 inf output\\n```\\nThe example output has been trimmed in the middle for brevity.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 0, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.999436'}}, 'page_content': '\\\\* correct / len(test\\\\_loader.dataset)}\\')\\n```\\nTypically from here, one could either throw all of this into a python script or run it on a Jupyter Notebook. However, how would you then get this script to run on say two GPUs or on multiple machines if these resources are available, which could improve training speed through \\\\*distributed\\\\* training? Just doing `python myscript.py` will only ever run the script using a single GPU. This is where `torch.distributed` comes into play\\n## PyTorch Distributed Data Parallelism\\nAs the name implies, `torch.distributed` is meant to work on \\\\*distributed\\\\* setups. This can include multi-node, where you have a number of machines each with a single GPU, or multi-gpu where a single system has multiple GPUs, or some combination of both. To convert our above code to work within a distributed setup, a few setup configurations must first be defined, detailed in the [Getting Started with DDP Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp\\\\_tutorial.html)\\nFirst a `setup` and a `cleanup` function must be declared. This will open up a processing group that all of the compute processes can communicate through\\n> Note: for this section of the tutorial it should be assumed these are sent in python script files. Later on a launcher using Accelerate will be discussed that removes this necessity\\n```python\\nimport os\\nimport torch.distributed as dist\\ndef setup(rank, world\\\\_size):\\n\"Sets up the process group and configuration for PyTorch Distributed Data Parallelism\"\\nos.environ[\"MASTER\\\\_ADDR\"] = \\'localhost\\'\\nos.environ[\"MASTER\\\\_PORT\"] = \"12355\"\\n# Initialize the process group\\ndist.init\\\\_process\\\\_group(\"gloo\", rank=rank, world\\\\_size=world\\\\_size)\\ndef cleanup():\\n\"Cleans up the distributed environment\"\\ndist.destroy\\\\_process\\\\_group()\\n```\\nThe last piece of the puzzle is \\\\*how do I send my data and model to another GPU?\\\\*\\nThis is where the `DistributedDataParallel` module comes into play. It will copy your model onto each GPU, and when `loss.backward()` is called the backpropagation is performed and the resulting gradients across all these copies of the model will be averaged/reduced. This ensures each device has the same weights post the optimizer step. Below is an example of our training setup, refactored as a function, with this capability:\\n> Note: Here rank is the overall rank of the current GPU compared to all the other GPUs available, meaning they have a rank of `0 -> n-1`\\n```python\\nfrom torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel as DDP\\ndef train(model, rank, world\\\\_size):\\nsetup(rank, world\\\\_size)\\nmodel = model.to(rank)\\nddp\\\\_model = DDP(model, device\\\\_ids=[rank])\\noptimizer = optim.AdamW(ddp\\\\_model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)\\n# Train for one epoch\\nmodel.train()\\nfor batch\\\\_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(train\\\\_loader):\\ndata, target = data.to(device), target.to(device)\\noutput = model(data)\\nloss = F.nll\\\\_loss(output, target)\\nloss.backward()\\noptimizer.step()\\noptimizer.zero\\\\_grad()\\ncleanup()\\n```\\nThe optimizer needs to be declared based on the model \\\\*on the specific device\\\\* (so `ddp\\\\_model` and not `model`) for all of the gradients to properly be calculated. Lastly, to run the script PyTorch has a convenient `torchrun` command line module that can help. Just pass in the number of nodes it should use as well as the script to run and you are set:\\n```bash\\ntorchrun --nproc\\\\_per\\\\_node=2 --nnodes=1 example\\\\_script.py\\n```\\nThe above will run the training script on two GPUs that live on a single machine and this is the barebones for performing only distributed training with PyTorch.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 15, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.9993599'}}, 'page_content': \"When you will face a real project that will be running for hours and perhaps days, definitely spend more time to make sure you use the most optimal hyper-parameters to get your job done faster and at a minimal cost.

Because Stable Diffusion was trained on an English dataset, it is required to translate non-English prompts to English first. Surprisingly, Stable Diffusion can sometimes generate proper images even when using non-English prompts. So, why do we need a language-specific Stable Diffusion? The answer is because we want a text-to-image model that can understand Japanese culture, identity, and unique expressions including slang.

Using transfer learning with pre-trained spaCy models, the assistant was able to:\\n- Analyze text and transform words into lemmas,\\n- Perform a linguistic analysis,\\n- Extract the linguistic features from the text (plural and singular forms, gender), part-of-speech tags (pronouns, verbs, nouns, adjectives, etc.), word dependencies labels, named entity recognition, etc. By detecting and filtering words according to a specific knowledge base using linguistic features, the assistant could highlight non-inclusive words and suggest alternatives in real-time. ### Challenge\\nThe vocabulary had around 2300 non-inclusive words and idioms in German and English correspondingly. And the above described basic approach worked well for 85% of the vocabulary but failed for context-dependent words. Therefore the task was to build a context-dependent classifier of non-inclusive words. Such a challenge (understanding the context rather than recognizing linguistic features) led to using Hugging Face transformers. ```diff\\nExample of context dependent non-inclusive words:\\nFossil fuels are not renewable resources.\\n\\nWhether and to what extent bias in the system concretely affects people ultimately depends on what the system is used for. As such, the first place developers can work to mitigate bias is when deciding how ML fits in their system, e.g., by deciding what optimization objective it will use. For example, let‚Äôs go back to one of the first highly-publicized cases of a Machine Learning system used in production for algorithmic content recommendation. From 2006 to 2009, Netflix ran the [Netflix Prize](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/KDD-cup-2007/proceedings/The-Netflix-Prize-Bennett.pdf), a competition with a 1M$ cash prize challenging teams around the world to develop ML systems to accurately predict a user‚Äôs rating for a new movie based on their past ratings. The [winning submission](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/statistics/dmsl/GrandPrize2009\\\\_BPC\\\\_BigChaos.pdf) improved the RMSE (Root-mean-square-error) of predictions on unseen user-movie pairs by over 10% over Netflix‚Äôs own CineMatch algorithm, meaning it got much better at predicting how users would rate a new movie based on their history.\\n\\nStill, some numbers are hard to ignore. ### So? Am I excited by Megatron-Turing NLG 530B and whatever beast is coming next? No. Do I think that the (relatively small) benchmark improvement is worth the added cost, complexity and carbon footprint? No. Do I think that building and promoting these huge models is helping organizations understand and adopt Machine Learning ? No. I'm left wondering what's the point of it all. Science for the sake of science? Good old marketing? Technological supremacy? Probably a bit of each. I'll leave them to it, then. Instead, let me focus on pragmatic and actionable techniques that you can all use to build high quality Machine Learning solutions. ### Use Pretrained Models\\nIn the vast majority of cases, you won't need a custom model architecture. Maybe you'll \\\\*want\\\\* a custom one (which is a different thing), but there be dragons. Experts only! A good starting point is to look for [models](https://huggingface.co/models) that have been pretrained for the task you're trying to solve (say, [summarizing English text](https://huggingface.co/models?language=en&pipeline\\\\_tag=summarization&sort=downloads)). Then, you should quickly try out a few models to predict your own data. If metrics tell you that one works well enough, you're done! If you need a little more accuracy, you should consider fine-tuning the model (more on this in a minute). ### Use Smaller Models\\nWhen evaluating models, you should pick the smallest one that can deliver the accuracy you need. It will predict faster and require fewer hardware resources for training and inference. Frugality goes a long way. It's nothing new either. Computer Vision practitioners will remember when [SqueezeNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07360) came out in 2017, achieving a 50x reduction in model size compared to [AlexNet](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2012/hash/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Abstract.html), while meeting or exceeding its accuracy. How clever that was! Downsizing efforts are also under way in the Natural Language Processing community, using transfer learning techniques such as [knowledge distillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge\\\\_distillation). [DistilBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108) is perhaps its most widely known achievement. Compared to the original BERT model, it retains 97% of language understanding while being 40% smaller and 60% faster. You can try it [here](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased).

Using transfer learning with pre-trained spaCy models, the assistant was able to:\\n- Analyze text and transform words into lemmas,\\n- Perform a linguistic analysis,\\n- Extract the linguistic features from the text (plural and singular forms, gender), part-of-speech tags (pronouns, verbs, nouns, adjectives, etc.), word dependencies labels, named entity recognition, etc. By detecting and filtering words according to a specific knowledge base using linguistic features, the assistant could highlight non-inclusive words and suggest alternatives in real-time. ### Challenge\\nThe vocabulary had around 2300 non-inclusive words and idioms in German and English correspondingly. And the above described basic approach worked well for 85% of the vocabulary but failed for context-dependent words. Therefore the task was to build a context-dependent classifier of non-inclusive words. Such a challenge (understanding the context rather than recognizing linguistic features) led to using Hugging Face transformers. ```diff\\nExample of context dependent non-inclusive words:\\nFossil fuels are not renewable resources.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 12, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.99915266'}}, 'page_content': 'Whether and to what extent bias in the system concretely affects people ultimately depends on what the system is used for. As such, the first place developers can work to mitigate bias is when deciding how ML fits in their system, e.g., by deciding what optimization objective it will use. For example, let‚Äôs go back to one of the first highly-publicized cases of a Machine Learning system used in production for algorithmic content recommendation. From 2006 to 2009, Netflix ran the [Netflix Prize](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/KDD-cup-2007/proceedings/The-Netflix-Prize-Bennett.pdf), a competition with a 1M$ cash prize challenging teams around the world to develop ML systems to accurately predict a user‚Äôs rating for a new movie based on their past ratings.

Am I excited by Megatron-Turing NLG 530B and whatever beast is coming next? No. Do I think that the (relatively small) benchmark improvement is worth the added cost, complexity and carbon footprint? No. Do I think that building and promoting these huge models is helping organizations understand and adopt Machine Learning ? No. I'm left wondering what's the point of it all. Science for the sake of science? Good old marketing? Technological supremacy? Probably a bit of each. I'll leave them to it, then. Instead, let me focus on pragmatic and actionable techniques that you can all use to build high quality Machine Learning solutions. ### Use Pretrained Models\\nIn the vast majority of cases, you won't need a custom model architecture. Maybe you'll \\\\*want\\\\* a custom one (which is a different thing), but there be dragons. Experts only! A good starting point is to look for [models](https://huggingface.co/models) that have been pretrained for the task you're trying to solve (say, [summarizing English text](https://huggingface.co/models?language=en&pipeline\\\\_tag=summarization&sort=downloads)). Then, you should quickly try out a few models to predict your own data. If metrics tell you that one works well enough, you're done! If you need a little more accuracy, you should consider fine-tuning the model (more on this in a minute). ### Use Smaller Models\\nWhen evaluating models, you should pick the smallest one that can deliver the accuracy you need. It will predict faster and require fewer hardware resources for training and inference. Frugality goes a long way. It's nothing new either. Computer Vision practitioners will remember when [SqueezeNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07360) came out in 2017, achieving a 50x reduction in model size compared to [AlexNet](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2012/hash/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Abstract.html), while meeting or exceeding its accuracy. How clever that was! Downsizing efforts are also under way in the Natural Language Processing community, using transfer learning techniques such as [knowledge distillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge\\\\_distillation). [DistilBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108) is perhaps its most widely known achievement. Compared to the original BERT model, it retains 97% of language understanding while being 40% smaller and 60% faster. You can try it [here](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased). The same approach has been applied to other models, such as Facebook's [BART](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461), and you can try DistilBART [here](https://huggingface.co/models?search=distilbart).
