Then we design a subject representation learning task which enables a diffusion model to leverage such visual representation and generates new subject renditions. Compared with previous methods such as DreamBooth, our model enables zero-shot subject-driven generation, and efficient fine-tuning for customized subject with up to 20x speedup. We also demonstrate that BLIP-Diffusion can be flexibly combined with existing techniques such as ControlNet and prompt-to-prompt to enable novel subject-driven generation and editing applications.

Project page at [this https URL](https://dxli94.github.io/BLIP-Diffusion-website/).\\\\*\\nThe original codebase can be found at [salesforce/LAVIS](https://github.com/salesforce/LAVIS/tree/main/projects/blip-diffusion). You can find the official BLIP-Diffusion checkpoints under the [hf.co/SalesForce](https://hf.co/SalesForce) organization. `BlipDiffusionPipeline` and `BlipDiffusionControlNetPipeline` were contributed by [`ayushtues`](https://github.com/ayushtues/). Make sure to check out the Schedulers [guide](../../using-diffusers/schedulers) to learn how to explore the tradeoff between scheduler speed and quality, and see the [reuse components across pipelines](../../using-diffusers/loading#reuse-components-across-pipelines) section to learn how to efficiently load the same components into multiple pipelines. ## BlipDiffusionPipeline\\n[[autodoc]] BlipDiffusionPipeline\\n- all\\n- \\\\_\\\\_call\\\\_\\\\_\\n## BlipDiffusionControlNetPipeline\\n[[autodoc]] BlipDiffusionControlNetPipeline\\n- all\\n- \\\\_\\\\_call\\\\_\\\\_', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689aad263e684812d15f61b2', 'page_content': '!--Copyright 2023 The HuggingFace Team.

BLIP is a model that is able to perform various multi-modal tasks including:\\n- Visual Question Answering\\n- Image-Text retrieval (Image-text matching)\\n- Image Captioning\\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) has advanced the performance for many vision-language tasks.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '6899b87faf3d2ebb270a0670', 'page_content': \"--\\ntitle: Stable Diffusion with 🧨 Diffusers\\nthumbnail: /blog/assets/98\\\\_stable\\\\_diffusion/thumbnail.png\\nauthors:\\n- user: valhalla\\n- user: pcuenq\\n- user: natolambert\\n- user: patrickvonplaten\\n---\\n# Stable Diffusion with 🧨 Diffusers\\n[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/stable_diffusion.ipynb)\\n# \\\\*\\\\*Stable Diffusion\\\\*\\\\* 🎨\\n\\\\*...using 🧨 Diffusers\\\\*\\nStable Diffusion is a text-to-image latent diffusion model created by the researchers and engineers from [CompVis](https://github.com/CompVis), [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/) and [LAION](https://laion.ai/).

It\\'s an\\nencoder-decoder transformer pre-trained in a text-to-text denoising generative setting. LongT5 model is an extension of\\nT5 model, and it enables using one of the two different efficient attention mechanisms - (1) Local attention, or (2)\\nTransient-Global attention. The abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*Recent work has shown that either (1) increasing the input length or (2) increasing model size can improve the\\nperformance of Transformer-based neural models. In this paper, we present a new model, called LongT5, with which we\\nexplore the effects of scaling both the input length and model size at the same time. Specifically, we integrated\\nattention ideas from long-input transformers (ETC), and adopted pre-training strategies from summarization pre-training\\n(PEGASUS) into the scalable T5 architecture. The result is a new attention mechanism we call {\\\\em Transient Global}\\n(TGlobal), which mimics ETC\\'s local/global attention mechanism, but without requiring additional side-inputs. We are\\nable to achieve state-of-the-art results on several summarization tasks and outperform the original T5 models on\\nquestion answering tasks.\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [stancld](https://huggingface.co/stancld). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/longt5). ## Usage tips\\n- [`LongT5ForConditionalGeneration`] is an extension of [`T5ForConditionalGeneration`] exchanging the traditional\\nencoder \\\\*self-attention\\\\* layer with efficient either \\\\*local\\\\* attention or \\\\*transient-global\\\\* (\\\\*tglobal\\\\*) attention. - Unlike the T5 model, LongT5 does not use a task prefix. Furthermore, it uses a different pre-training objective\\ninspired by the pre-training of [`PegasusForConditionalGeneration`]. - LongT5 model is designed to work efficiently and very well on long-range \\\\*sequence-to-sequence\\\\* tasks where the\\ninput sequence exceeds commonly used 512 tokens. It is capable of handling input sequences of a length up to 16,384 tokens. - For \\\\*Local Attention\\\\*, the sparse sliding-window local attention operation allows a given token to attend only `r`\\ntokens to the left and right of it (with `r=127` by default). \\\\*Local Attention\\\\* does not introduce any new parameters\\nto the model. The complexity of the mechanism is linear in input sequence length `l`: `O(l\\\\*r)`. - \\\\*Transient Global Attention\\\\* is an extension of the \\\\*Local Attention\\\\*. It, furthermore, allows each input token to\\ninteract with all other tokens in the layer. This is achieved via splitting an input sequence into blocks of a fixed\\nlength `k` (with a default `k=16`). Then, a global token for such a block is obtained via summing and normalizing the embeddings of every token\\nin the block. Thanks to this, the attention allows each token to attend to both nearby tokens like in Local attention, and\\nalso every global token like in the case of standard global attention (\\\\*transient\\\\* represents the fact the global tokens\\nare constructed dynamically within each attention operation). As a consequence, \\\\*TGlobal\\\\* attention introduces\\na few new parameters -- global relative position biases and a layer normalization for global token\\'s embedding.\\n\\nWith our sliding window approach, however, there is overlap in\\nthe tokens we pass to the model at each iteration. We don\\'t want the log-likelihood for the tokens we\\'re just treating\\nas context to be included in our loss, so we can set these targets to `-100` so that they are ignored. The following\\nis an example of how we could do this with a stride of `512`. This means that the model will have at least 512 tokens\\nfor context when calculating the conditional likelihood of any one token (provided there are 512 preceding tokens\\navailable to condition on). ```python\\nimport torch\\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\\nmax\\\\_length = model.config.n\\\\_positions\\nstride = 512\\nseq\\\\_len = encodings.input\\\\_ids.size(1)\\nnlls = []\\nprev\\\\_end\\\\_loc = 0\\nfor begin\\\\_loc in tqdm(range(0, seq\\\\_len, stride)):\\nend\\\\_loc = min(begin\\\\_loc + max\\\\_length, seq\\\\_len)\\ntrg\\\\_len = end\\\\_loc - prev\\\\_end\\\\_loc # may be different from stride on last loop\\ninput\\\\_ids = encodings.input\\\\_ids[:, begin\\\\_loc:end\\\\_loc].to(device)\\ntarget\\\\_ids = input\\\\_ids.clone()\\ntarget\\\\_ids[:, :-trg\\\\_len] = -100\\nwith torch.no\\\\_grad():\\noutputs = model(input\\\\_ids, labels=target\\\\_ids)\\n# loss is calculated using CrossEntropyLoss which averages over valid labels\\n# N.B. the model only calculates loss over trg\\\\_len - 1 labels, because it internally shifts the labels\\n# to the left by 1. neg\\\\_log\\\\_likelihood = outputs.loss\\nnlls.append(neg\\\\_log\\\\_likelihood)\\nprev\\\\_end\\\\_loc = end\\\\_loc\\nif end\\\\_loc == seq\\\\_len:\\nbreak\\nppl = torch.exp(torch.stack(nlls).mean())\\n```\\nRunning this with the stride length equal to the max input length is equivalent to the suboptimal, non-sliding-window\\nstrategy we discussed above. The smaller the stride, the more context the model will have in making each prediction,\\nand the better the reported perplexity will typically be. When we run the above with `stride = 1024`, i.e. no overlap, the resulting PPL is `19.44`, which is about the same\\nas the `19.93` reported in the GPT-2 paper. By using `stride = 512` and thereby employing our striding window\\nstrategy, this jumps down to `16.45`. This is not only a more favorable score, but is calculated in a way that is\\ncloser to the true autoregressive decomposition of a sequence likelihood.\\n\\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ybelkada/documentation-images/resolve/main/mixtral-7b-inference-large-seqlen.png)\\n\\n### Sliding window Attention\\nThe current implementation supports the sliding window attention mechanism and memory efficient cache management. To enable sliding window attention, just make sure to have a `flash-attn` version that is compatible with sliding window attention (`>=2.3.0`). The Flash Attention-2 model uses also a more memory efficient cache slicing mechanism - as recommended per the official implementation of Mistral model that use rolling cache mechanism we keep the cache size fixed (`self.config.sliding\\\\_window`), support batched generation only for `padding\\\\_side=\"left\"` and use the absolute position of the current token to compute the positional embedding. ## The Mistral Team\\nAlbert Jiang, Alexandre Sablayrolles, Arthur Mensch, Chris Bamford, Devendra Singh Chaplot, Diego de las Casas, Florian Bressand, Gianna Lengyel, Guillaume Lample, Lélio Renard Lavaud, Lucile Saulnier, Marie-Anne Lachaux, Pierre Stock, Teven Le Scao, Thibaut Lavril, Thomas Wang, Timothée Lacroix, William El Sayed. ## MixtralConfig\\n[[autodoc]] MixtralConfig\\n## MixtralModel\\n[[autodoc]] MixtralModel\\n- forward\\n## MixtralForCausalLM\\n[[autodoc]] MixtralForCausalLM\\n- forward\\n## MixtralForSequenceClassification\\n[[autodoc]] MixtralForSequenceClassification\\n- forward', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': '58c7b67f-64b8-4576-893c-1d965fb20a79', 'tool_call_id': 'call_b9nYcpkD7z8ovPlviWIAtQo8', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689aa9783e684812d15f5d02', 'page_content': '!--Copyright 2022 The HuggingFace Team.

It is a generic, \\\\*task-first\\\\* pipeline that lets you focus on the task. The `AutoPipeline` automatically detects the correct pipeline class to use, which makes it easier to load a checkpoint for a task without knowing the specific pipeline class name. Take a look at the [AutoPipeline](../api/pipelines/auto\\\\_pipeline) reference to see which tasks are supported. Currently, it supports text-to-image, image-to-image, and inpainting. This tutorial shows you how to use an `AutoPipeline` to automatically infer the pipeline class to load for a specific task, given the pretrained weights. ## Choose an AutoPipeline for your task\\nStart by picking a checkpoint. For example, if you\\'re interested in text-to-image with the [runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5) checkpoint, use [`AutoPipelineForText2Image`]:\\n```py\\nfrom diffusers import AutoPipelineForText2Image\\nimport torch\\npipeline = AutoPipelineForText2Image.from\\\\_pretrained(\\n\"runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5\", torch\\\\_dtype=torch.float16, use\\\\_safetensors=True\\n).to(\"cuda\")\\nprompt = \"peasant and dragon combat, wood cutting style, viking era, bevel with rune\"\\nimage = pipeline(prompt, num\\\\_inference\\\\_steps=25).images[0]\\nimage\\n```\\n\\n![generated image of peasant fighting dragon in wood cutting style](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/diffusers/autopipeline-text2img.png)\\n\\nUnder the hood, [`AutoPipelineForText2Image`]:\\n1. automatically detects a `\"stable-diffusion\"` class from the [`model\\\\_index.json`](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5/blob/main/model\\\\_index.json) file\\n2. loads the corresponding text-to-image [`StableDiffusionPipeline`] based on the `\"stable-diffusion\"` class name\\nLikewise, for image-to-image, [`AutoPipelineForImage2Image`] detects a `\"stable-diffusion\"` checkpoint from the `model\\\\_index.json` file and it\\'ll load the corresponding [`StableDiffusionImg2ImgPipeline`] behind the scenes. You can also pass any additional arguments specific to the pipeline class such as `strength`, which determines the amount of noise or variation added to an input image:\\n```py\\nfrom diffusers import AutoPipelineForImage2Image\\nimport torch\\nimport requests\\nfrom PIL import Image\\nfrom io import BytesIO\\npipeline = AutoPipelineForImage2Image.from\\\\_pretrained(\\n\"runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5\",\\ntorch\\\\_dtype=torch.float16,\\nuse\\\\_safetensors=True,\\n).to(\"cuda\")\\nprompt = \"a portrait of a dog wearing a pearl earring\"\\nurl = \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/1665\\\\_Girl\\\\_with\\\\_a\\\\_Pearl\\\\_Earring.jpg/800px-1665\\\\_Girl\\\\_with\\\\_a\\\\_Pearl\\\\_Earring.jpg\"\\nresponse = requests.get(url)\\nimage = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content)).convert(\"RGB\")\\nimage.thumbnail((768, 768))\\nimage = pipeline(prompt, image, num\\\\_inference\\\\_steps=200, strength=0.75, guidance\\\\_scale=10.5).images[0]\\nimage\\n```\\n\\n![generated image of a vermeer portrait of a dog wearing a pearl earring](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/diffusers/autopipeline-img2img.png)\\n\\nAnd if you want to do inpainting, then [`AutoPipelineForInpainting`] loads the underlying [`StableDiffusionInpaintPipeline`] class in the same way:\\n```py\\nfrom diffusers import AutoPipelineForInpainting\\nfrom diffusers.utils import load\\\\_image\\nimport torch\\npipeline = AutoPipelineForInpainting.from\\\\_pretrained(\\n\"stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0\", torch\\\\_dtype=torch.float16, use\\\\_safetensors=True\\n).to(\"cuda\")\\nimg\\\\_url = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion/main/data/inpainting\\\\_examples/overture-creations-5sI6fQgYIuo.png\"\\nmask\\\\_url = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion/main/data/inpainting\\\\_examples/overture-creations-5sI6fQgYIuo\\\\_mask.png\"\\ninit\\\\_image = load\\\\_image(img\\\\_url).convert(\"RGB\")\\nmask\\\\_image = load\\\\_image(mask\\\\_url).convert(\"RGB\")\\nprompt = \"A majestic tiger sitting on a bench\"\\nimage = pipeline(prompt, image=init\\\\_image, mask\\\\_image=mask\\\\_image, num\\\\_inference\\\\_steps=50, strength=0.80).images[0]\\nimage\\n```\\n\\n![generated image of a tiger sitting on a bench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/diffusers/autopipeline-inpaint.png)\\n\\nIf you try to load an unsupported checkpoint, it\\'ll throw an error:\\n```py\\nfrom diffusers import AutoPipelineForImage2Image\\nimport torch\\npipeline = AutoPipelineForImage2Image.from\\\\_pretrained(\\n\"openai/shap-e-img2img\", torch\\\\_dtype=torch.float16, use\\\\_safetensors=True\\n)\\n\"ValueError: AutoPipeline can\\'t find a pipeline linked to ShapEImg2ImgPipeline for None\"\\n```\\n## Use multiple pipelines\\nFor some workflows or if you\\'re loading many pipelines, it is more memory-efficient to reuse the same components from a checkpoint instead of reloading them which would unnecessarily consume additional memory.\\n\\n!--Copyright 2023 The HuggingFace Team.

It is a generic, \\\\*task-first\\\\* pipeline that lets you focus on the task. The `AutoPipeline` automatically detects the correct pipeline class to use, which makes it easier to load a checkpoint for a task without knowing the specific pipeline class name. Take a look at the [AutoPipeline](../api/pipelines/auto\\\\_pipeline) reference to see which tasks are supported. Currently, it supports text-to-image, image-to-image, and inpainting. This tutorial shows you how to use an `AutoPipeline` to automatically infer the pipeline class to load for a specific task, given the pretrained weights. ## Choose an AutoPipeline for your task\\nStart by picking a checkpoint. For example, if you\\'re interested in text-to-image with the [runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5) checkpoint, use [`AutoPipelineForText2Image`]:\\n```py\\nfrom diffusers import AutoPipelineForText2Image\\nimport torch\\npipeline = AutoPipelineForText2Image.from\\\\_pretrained(\\n\"runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5\", torch\\\\_dtype=torch.float16, use\\\\_safetensors=True\\n).to(\"cuda\")\\nprompt = \"peasant and dragon combat, wood cutting style, viking era, bevel with rune\"\\nimage = pipeline(prompt, num\\\\_inference\\\\_steps=25).images[0]\\nimage\\n```\\n\\n![generated image of peasant fighting dragon in wood cutting style](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/diffusers/autopipeline-text2img.png)\\n\\nUnder the hood, [`AutoPipelineForText2Image`]:\\n1. automatically detects a `\"stable-diffusion\"` class from the [`model\\\\_index.json`](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5/blob/main/model\\\\_index.json) file\\n2. loads the corresponding text-to-image [`StableDiffusionPipeline`] based on the `\"stable-diffusion\"` class name\\nLikewise, for image-to-image, [`AutoPipelineForImage2Image`] detects a `\"stable-diffusion\"` checkpoint from the `model\\\\_index.json` file and it\\'ll load the corresponding [`StableDiffusionImg2ImgPipeline`] behind the scenes. You can also pass any additional arguments specific to the pipeline class such as `strength`, which determines the amount of noise or variation added to an input image:\\n```py\\nfrom diffusers import AutoPipelineForImage2Image\\nimport torch\\nimport requests\\nfrom PIL import Image\\nfrom io import BytesIO\\npipeline = AutoPipelineForImage2Image.from\\\\_pretrained(\\n\"runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5\",\\ntorch\\\\_dtype=torch.float16,\\nuse\\\\_safetensors=True,\\n).to(\"cuda\")\\nprompt = \"a portrait of a dog wearing a pearl earring\"\\nurl = \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/1665\\\\_Girl\\\\_with\\\\_a\\\\_Pearl\\\\_Earring.jpg/800px-1665\\\\_Girl\\\\_with\\\\_a\\\\_Pearl\\\\_Earring.jpg\"\\nresponse = requests.get(url)\\nimage = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content)).convert(\"RGB\")\\nimage.thumbnail((768, 768))\\nimage = pipeline(prompt, image, num\\\\_inference\\\\_steps=200, strength=0.75, guidance\\\\_scale=10.5).images[0]\\nimage\\n```\\n\\n![generated image of a vermeer portrait of a dog wearing a pearl earring](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/diffusers/autopipeline-img2img.png)\\n\\nAnd if you want to do inpainting, then [`AutoPipelineForInpainting`] loads the underlying [`StableDiffusionInpaintPipeline`] class in the same way:\\n```py\\nfrom diffusers import AutoPipelineForInpainting\\nfrom diffusers.utils import load\\\\_image\\nimport torch\\npipeline = AutoPipelineForInpainting.from\\\\_pretrained(\\n\"stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0\", torch\\\\_dtype=torch.float16, use\\\\_safetensors=True\\n).to(\"cuda\")\\nimg\\\\_url = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion/main/data/inpainting\\\\_examples/overture-creations-5sI6fQgYIuo.png\"\\nmask\\\\_url = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion/main/data/inpainting\\\\_examples/overture-creations-5sI6fQgYIuo\\\\_mask.png\"\\ninit\\\\_image = load\\\\_image(img\\\\_url).convert(\"RGB\")\\nmask\\\\_image = load\\\\_image(mask\\\\_url).convert(\"RGB\")\\nprompt = \"A majestic tiger sitting on a bench\"\\nimage = pipeline(prompt, image=init\\\\_image, mask\\\\_image=mask\\\\_image, num\\\\_inference\\\\_steps=50, strength=0.80).images[0]\\nimage\\n```\\n\\n![generated image of a tiger sitting on a bench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/diffusers/autopipeline-inpaint.png)\\n\\nIf you try to load an unsupported checkpoint, it\\'ll throw an error:\\n```py\\nfrom diffusers import AutoPipelineForImage2Image\\nimport torch\\npipeline = AutoPipelineForImage2Image.from\\\\_pretrained(\\n\"openai/shap-e-img2img\", torch\\\\_dtype=torch.float16, use\\\\_safetensors=True\\n)\\n\"ValueError: AutoPipeline can\\'t find a pipeline linked to ShapEImg2ImgPipeline for None\"\\n```\\n## Use multiple pipelines\\nFor some workflows or if you\\'re loading many pipelines, it is more memory-efficient to reuse the same components from a checkpoint instead of reloading them which would unnecessarily consume additional memory.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689ab0233e684812d15f64e5', 'page_content': '!--Copyright 2023 The HuggingFace Team.

For instance, large language models can handle such NLP tasks as summarization, translation, classification, and more. This approach is no longer limited to a single modality, such as text, and in this guide, we will illustrate how you can\\nsolve image-text tasks with a large multimodal model called IDEFICS. [IDEFICS](../model\\\\_doc/idefics) is an open-access vision and language model based on [Flamingo](https://huggingface.co/papers/2204.14198),\\na state-of-the-art visual language model initially developed by DeepMind. The model accepts arbitrary sequences of image\\nand text inputs and generates coherent text as output. It can answer questions about images, describe visual content,\\ncreate stories grounded in multiple images, and so on. IDEFICS comes in two variants - [80 billion parameters](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceM4/idefics-80b)\\nand [9 billion parameters](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceM4/idefics-9b), both of which are available on the 🤗 Hub.\\n\\nModels such as [VisualGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10407), [VC-GPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12723), and [Flamingo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.14198) use this pre-training strategy and are trained on image captioning and visual question-answering tasks. The main goal of such models is to balance the mixture of text generation capacity and visual information efficiently, which is highly important in the absence of large multi-modal datasets. Models such as VisualGPT use a visual encoder to embed images and feed the visual embeddings to the cross-attention layers of a pre-trained language decoder module to generate plausible captions. A more recent work, [FIBER](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07643), inserts cross-attention layers with a gating mechanism into both vision and language backbones, for more efficient multi-modal fusing and enables various other downstream tasks, such as image-text retrieval and open vocabulary object detection. ### 4) Masked-Language Modeling / Image-Text Matching\\nAnother line of vision-language models uses a combination of Masked-Language Modeling (MLM) and Image-Text Matching (ITM) objectives to align specific parts of images with text and enable various downstream tasks such as visual question answering, visual commonsense reasoning, text-based image retrieval, and text-guided object detection. Models that follow this pre-training setup include [VisualBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03557), [FLAVA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04482), [ViLBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02265), [LXMERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07490) and [BridgeTower](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08657). ![MLM / ITM](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/128_vision_language_pretraining/mlm_itm.png)  \\n *Aligning parts of images with text ([image source](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02265))*\\n\\nLet’s break down what MLM and ITM objectives mean. Given a partially masked caption, the MLM objective is to predict the masked words based on the corresponding image. Note that the MLM objective requires either using a richly annotated multi-modal dataset with bounding boxes or using an object detection model to generate object region proposals for parts of the input text. For the ITM objective, given an image and caption pair, the task is to predict whether the caption matches the image or not.\\n\\n!--Copyright 2022 The HuggingFace Team. All rights reserved.

In this section we will introduce our \\\\*\\\\*newly developed\\\\*\\\\* low-level API called `gradio.Blocks`. Now, what\\'s the difference between `Interface` and `Blocks`? - ⚡ `Interface`: a high-level API that allows you to create a full machine learning demo simply by providing a list of inputs and outputs. - 🧱 `Blocks`: a low-level API that allows you to have full control over the data flows and layout of your application. You can build very complex, multi-step applications using `Blocks` (as in \"building blocks\"). ### Why Blocks 🧱?[[why-blocks-]]\\nAs we saw in the previous sections, the `Interface` class allows you to easily create full-fledged machine learning demos with just a few lines of code. The `Interface` API is extremely easy to use but lacks the flexibility that the `Blocks` API provides. For example, you might want to:\\n- Group together related demos as multiple tabs in one web application\\n- Change the layout of your demo, e.g. to specify where the inputs and outputs are located\\n- Have multi-step interfaces, in which the output of one model becomes the input to the next model, or have more flexible data flows in general\\n- Change a component\\'s properties (for example, the choices in a dropdown) or its visibility based on user input\\nWe will explore all of these concepts below. ### Creating a simple demo using Blocks[[creating-a-simple-demo-using-blocks]]\\nAfter you have installed Gradio, run the code below as a Python script, a Jupyter notebook, or a Colab notebook. ```py\\nimport gradio as gr\\ndef flip\\\\_text(x):\\nreturn x[::-1]\\ndemo = gr.Blocks()\\nwith demo:\\ngr.Markdown(\\n\"\"\"\\n# Flip Text!

Blocks allow you to build web applications that combine markdown, HTML, buttons, and interactive components simply by instantiating objects in Python inside of a `with gradio.Blocks` context.\\n\\n## An Overview of Gradio\\nSo far, we\\'ve been discussing the `Interface` class, which is a high-level class that lets to build demos quickly with Gradio. But what else does Gradio do? ### Chatbots with `gr.ChatInterface`\\nGradio includes another high-level class, `gr.ChatInterface`, which is specifically designed to create Chatbot UIs. Similar to `Interface`, you supply a function and Gradio creates a fully working Chatbot UI. If you\\'re interested in creating a chatbot, you can jump straight to [our dedicated guide on `gr.ChatInterface`](https://www.gradio.app/guides/creating-a-chatbot-fast). ### Custom Demos with `gr.Blocks`\\nGradio also offers a low-level approach for designing web apps with more flexible layouts and data flows with the `gr.Blocks` class. Blocks allows you to do things like control where components appear on the page, handle complex data flows (e.g. outputs can serve as inputs to other functions), and update properties/visibility of components based on user interaction — still all in Python. You can build very custom and complex applications using `gr.Blocks()`. For example, the popular image generation [Automatic1111 Web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) is built using Gradio Blocks. We dive deeper into the `gr.Blocks` on our series on [building with Blocks](https://www.gradio.app/guides/blocks-and-event-listeners). ### The Gradio Python & JavaScript Ecosystem\\nThat\\'s the gist of the core `gradio` Python library, but Gradio is actually so much more! Its an entire ecosystem of Python and JavaScript libraries that let you build machine learning applications, or query them programmatically, in Python or JavaScript. Here are other related parts of the Gradio ecosystem:\\n\\\\* [Gradio Python Client](https://www.gradio.app/guides/getting-started-with-the-python-client) (`gradio\\\\_client`): query any Gradio app programmatically in Python. \\\\* [Gradio JavaScript Client](https://www.gradio.app/guides/getting-started-with-the-js-client) (`@gradio/client`): query any Gradio app programmatically in JavaScript. \\\\* [Gradio-Lite](https://www.gradio.app/guides/gradio-lite) (`@gradio/lite`): write Gradio apps in Python that run entirely in the browser (no server needed!), thanks to Pyodide. \\\\* [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces): the most popular place to host Gradio applications — for free!\\n\\nAll components are now keyboard navigable and include better colors to be usable by a wider audience. ![](https://media0.giphy.com/media/Kv1bAN7MX3ya5krkEU/giphy.gif)\\n\\\\*\\\\*3.

Iandola, Albert E. Shaw, Ravi Krishna, Kurt W. Keutzer. It\\'s a\\nbidirectional transformer similar to the BERT model. The key difference between the BERT architecture and the\\nSqueezeBERT architecture is that SqueezeBERT uses [grouped convolutions](https://blog.yani.io/filter-group-tutorial)\\ninstead of fully-connected layers for the Q, K, V and FFN layers.\\n\\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*Humans read and write hundreds of billions of messages every day. Further, due to the availability of large datasets,\\nlarge computing systems, and better neural network models, natural language processing (NLP) technology has made\\nsignificant strides in understanding, proofreading, and organizing these messages. Thus, there is a significant\\nopportunity to deploy NLP in myriad applications to help web users, social networks, and businesses. In particular, we\\nconsider smartphones and other mobile devices as crucial platforms for deploying NLP models at scale. However, today\\'s\\nhighly-accurate NLP neural network models such as BERT and RoBERTa are extremely computationally expensive, with\\nBERT-base taking 1.7 seconds to classify a text snippet on a Pixel 3 smartphone. In this work, we observe that methods\\nsuch as grouped convolutions have yielded significant speedups for computer vision networks, but many of these\\ntechniques have not been adopted by NLP neural network designers. We demonstrate how to replace several operations in\\nself-attention layers with grouped convolutions, and we use this technique in a novel network architecture called\\nSqueezeBERT, which runs 4.3x faster than BERT-base on the Pixel 3 while achieving competitive accuracy on the GLUE test\\nset. The SqueezeBERT code will be released.\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [forresti](https://huggingface.co/forresti). ## Usage tips\\n- SqueezeBERT is a model with absolute position embeddings so it\\'s usually advised to pad the inputs on the right\\nrather than the left. - SqueezeBERT is similar to BERT and therefore relies on the masked language modeling (MLM) objective. It is therefore\\nefficient at predicting masked tokens and at NLU in general, but is not optimal for text generation. Models trained\\nwith a causal language modeling (CLM) objective are better in that regard. - For best results when finetuning on sequence classification tasks, it is recommended to start with the\\n\\\\*squeezebert/squeezebert-mnli-headless\\\\* checkpoint. ## Resources\\n- [Text classification task guide](../tasks/sequence\\\\_classification)\\n- [Token classification task guide](../tasks/token\\\\_classification)\\n- [Question answering task guide](../tasks/question\\\\_answering)\\n- [Masked language modeling task guide](../tasks/masked\\\\_language\\\\_modeling)\\n- [Multiple choice task guide](../tasks/multiple\\\\_choice)\\n## SqueezeBertConfig\\n[[autodoc]] SqueezeBertConfig\\n## SqueezeBertTokenizer\\n[[autodoc]] SqueezeBertTokenizer\\n- build\\\\_inputs\\\\_with\\\\_special\\\\_tokens\\n- get\\\\_special\\\\_tokens\\\\_mask\\n- create\\\\_token\\\\_type\\\\_ids\\\\_from\\\\_sequences\\n- save\\\\_vocabulary\\n## SqueezeBertTokenizerFast\\n[[autodoc]] SqueezeBertTokenizerFast\\n## SqueezeBertModel\\n[[autodoc]] SqueezeBertModel\\n## SqueezeBertForMaskedLM\\n[[autodoc]] SqueezeBertForMaskedLM\\n## SqueezeBertForSequenceClassification\\n[[autodoc]] SqueezeBertForSequenceClassification\\n## SqueezeBertForMultipleChoice\\n[[autodoc]] SqueezeBertForMultipleChoice\\n## SqueezeBertForTokenClassification\\n[[autodoc]] SqueezeBertForTokenClassification\\n## SqueezeBertForQuestionAnswering\\n[[autodoc]] SqueezeBertForQuestionAnswering\\n\\nIn the original model it is possible to use an average pooling layer with a fixed 7x7 window and stride 1 instead of global pooling. For inputs that are larger than the recommended image size, this gives a pooled output that is larger than 1x1. The Hugging Face implementation does not support this. - The original TensorFlow checkpoints include quantized models. We do not support these models as they include additional \"FakeQuantization\" operations to unquantize the weights. - It\\'s common to extract the output from the expansion layers at indices 10 and 13, as well as the output from the final 1x1 convolution layer, for downstream purposes.

Iandola, Albert E. Shaw, Ravi Krishna, Kurt W. Keutzer. It\\'s a\\nbidirectional transformer similar to the BERT model. The key difference between the BERT architecture and the\\nSqueezeBERT architecture is that SqueezeBERT uses [grouped convolutions](https://blog.yani.io/filter-group-tutorial)\\ninstead of fully-connected layers for the Q, K, V and FFN layers.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689aaa5a3e684812d15f5e41', 'page_content': \"The abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*Humans read and write hundreds of billions of messages every day. Further, due to the availability of large datasets,\\nlarge computing systems, and better neural network models, natural language processing (NLP) technology has made\\nsignificant strides in understanding, proofreading, and organizing these messages. Thus, there is a significant\\nopportunity to deploy NLP in myriad applications to help web users, social networks, and businesses. In particular, we\\nconsider smartphones and other mobile devices as crucial platforms for deploying NLP models at scale. However, today's\\nhighly-accurate NLP neural network models such as BERT and RoBERTa are extremely computationally expensive, with\\nBERT-base taking 1.7 seconds to classify a text snippet on a Pixel 3 smartphone. In this work, we observe that methods\\nsuch as grouped convolutions have yielded significant speedups for computer vision networks, but many of these\\ntechniques have not been adopted by NLP neural network designers. We demonstrate how to replace several operations in\\nself-attention layers with grouped convolutions, and we use this technique in a novel network architecture called\\nSqueezeBERT, which runs 4.3x faster than BERT-base on the Pixel 3 while achieving competitive accuracy on the GLUE test\\nset. The SqueezeBERT code will be released.\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [forresti](https://huggingface.co/forresti). ## Usage tips\\n- SqueezeBERT is a model with absolute position embeddings so it's usually advised to pad the inputs on the right\\nrather than the left. - SqueezeBERT is similar to BERT and therefore relies on the masked language modeling (MLM) objective. It is therefore\\nefficient at predicting masked tokens and at NLU in general, but is not optimal for text generation. Models trained\\nwith a causal language modeling (CLM) objective are better in that regard. - For best results when finetuning on sequence classification tasks, it is recommended to start with the\\n\\\\*squeezebert/squeezebert-mnli-headless\\\\* checkpoint. ## Resources\\n- [Text classification task guide](../tasks/sequence\\\\_classification)\\n- [Token classification task guide](../tasks/token\\\\_classification)\\n- [Question answering task guide](../tasks/question\\\\_answering)\\n- [Masked language modeling task guide](../tasks/masked\\\\_language\\\\_modeling)\\n- [Multiple choice task guide](../tasks/multiple\\\\_choice)\\n## SqueezeBertConfig\\n[[autodoc]] SqueezeBertConfig\\n## SqueezeBertTokenizer\\n[[autodoc]] SqueezeBertTokenizer\\n- build\\\\_inputs\\\\_with\\\\_special\\\\_tokens\\n- get\\\\_special\\\\_tokens\\\\_mask\\n- create\\\\_token\\\\_type\\\\_ids\\\\_from\\\\_sequences\\n- save\\\\_vocabulary\\n## SqueezeBertTokenizerFast\\n[[autodoc]] SqueezeBertTokenizerFast\\n## SqueezeBertModel\\n[[autodoc]] SqueezeBertModel\\n## SqueezeBertForMaskedLM\\n[[autodoc]] SqueezeBertForMaskedLM\\n## SqueezeBertForSequenceClassification\\n[[autodoc]] SqueezeBertForSequenceClassification\\n## SqueezeBertForMultipleChoice\\n[[autodoc]] SqueezeBertForMultipleChoice\\n## SqueezeBertForTokenClassification\\n[[autodoc]] SqueezeBertForTokenClassification\\n## SqueezeBertForQuestionAnswering\\n[[autodoc]] SqueezeBertForQuestionAnswering\", 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689aadeb3e684812d15f62a1', 'page_content': 'In the original model it is possible to use an average pooling layer with a fixed 7x7 window and stride 1 instead of global pooling.

Responsible model evaluation is a key part of this process, and 🤗 Evaluate is here to help! Here are some things to keep in mind when evaluating your model using the 🤗 Evaluate library:\\n## Properly splitting your data\\nGood evaluation generally requires three splits of your dataset:\\n- \\\\*\\\\*train\\\\*\\\\*: this is used for training your model. - \\\\*\\\\*validation\\\\*\\\\*: this is used for validating the model hyperparameters. - \\\\*\\\\*test\\\\*\\\\*: this is used for evaluating your model. Many of the datasets on the 🤗 Hub are separated into 2 splits: `train` and `validation`; others are split into 3 splits (`train`, `validation` and `test`) -- make sure to use the right split for the right purpose! Some datasets on the 🤗 Hub are already separated into these three splits. However, there are also many that only have a train/validation or only train split. If the dataset you\\'re using doesn\\'t have a predefined train-test split, it is up to you to define which part of the dataset you want to use for training your model and which you want to use for hyperparameter tuning or final evaluation. Training and evaluating on the same split can misrepresent your results! If you overfit on your training data the evaluation results on that split will look great but the model will perform poorly on new data. Depending on the size of the dataset, you can keep anywhere from 10-30% for evaluation and the rest for training, while aiming to set up the test set to reflect the production data as close as possible. Check out [this thread](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/how-to-split-main-dataset-into-train-dev-test-as-datasetdict/1090) for a more in-depth discussion of dataset splitting! ## The impact of class imbalance\\nWhile many academic datasets, such as the [IMDb dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imdb) of movie reviews, are perfectly balanced, most real-world datasets are not. In machine learning a \\\\*balanced dataset\\\\* corresponds to a datasets where all labels are represented equally. In the case of the IMDb dataset this means that there are as many positive as negative reviews in the dataset. In an imbalanced dataset this is not the case: in fraud detection for example there are usually many more non-fraud cases than fraud cases in the dataset. Having an imbalanced dataset can skew the results of your metrics. Imagine a dataset with 99 \"non-fraud\" cases and 1 \"fraud\" case.

Their success can be attributed to the self-attention mechanism, which captures the pairwise interactions between all the tokens in an input. However, the standard self-attention mechanism has a time and memory complexity of \\\\\\\\(O(n^2)\\\\\\\\) (where \\\\\\\\(n\\\\\\\\) is the length of the input sequence), making it expensive to train on long input sequences. The [Nyströmformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03902) is one of many efficient Transformer models that approximates standard self-attention with \\\\\\\\(O(n)\\\\\\\\) complexity. Nyströmformer exhibits competitive performance on various downstream NLP and CV tasks while improving upon the efficiency of standard self-attention. The aim of this blog post is to give readers an overview of the Nyström method and how it can be adapted to approximate self-attention. ## Nyström method for matrix approximation\\nAt the heart of Nyströmformer is the Nyström method for matrix approximation. It allows us to approximate a matrix by sampling some of its rows and columns. Let\\'s consider a matrix \\\\\\\\(P^{n \\\\times n}\\\\\\\\), which is expensive to compute in its entirety. So, instead, we approximate it using the Nyström method. We start by sampling \\\\\\\\(m\\\\\\\\) rows and columns from \\\\\\\\(P\\\\\\\\). We can then arrange the sampled rows and columns as follows:\\n\\nRepresenting P as a block matrix\\n\\nWe now have four submatrices: \\\\\\\\(A\\\\_P, B\\\\_P, F\\\\_P,\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\(C\\\\_P\\\\\\\\), with sizes \\\\\\\\(m \\\\times m, m \\\\times (n - m), (n - m) \\\\times m\\\\\\\\) and\\n\\\\\\\\((n - m) \\\\times (n - m)\\\\\\\\) respectively. The \\\\\\\\(m\\\\\\\\) sampled columns are contained in \\\\\\\\(A\\\\_P\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\(F\\\\_P\\\\\\\\), whereas the \\\\\\\\(m\\\\\\\\) sampled rows are contained in \\\\\\\\(A\\\\_P\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\(B\\\\_P\\\\\\\\). So, the entries of \\\\\\\\(A\\\\_P, B\\\\_P,\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\(F\\\\_P\\\\\\\\) are known to us, and we will estimate \\\\\\\\(C\\\\_P\\\\\\\\). According to the Nyström method, \\\\\\\\(C\\\\_P\\\\\\\\) is given by:\\n$$C\\\\_P = F\\\\_P A\\\\_P^+ B\\\\_P$$\\nHere, \\\\\\\\(+\\\\\\\\) denotes the Moore-Penrose inverse (or pseudoinverse). Thus, the Nyström approximation of \\\\\\\\(P, \\\\hat{P}\\\\\\\\) can be written as:\\n\\nNyström approximation of P\\n\\nAs shown in the second line, \\\\\\\\(\\\\hat{P}\\\\\\\\) can be expressed as a product of three matrices.\\n\\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*Transformers have emerged as a powerful tool for a broad range of natural language processing tasks. A key component\\nthat drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or\\ndependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the\\ninput sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences -- a topic being actively studied in the\\ncommunity. To address this limitation, we propose Nyströmformer -- a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a\\nfunction of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nyström method to approximate standard self-attention\\nwith O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nyströmformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of\\ntokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard\\nsequence length, and find that our Nyströmformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than\\nstandard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nyströmformer performs\\nfavorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods. Our code is available at this https URL.\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [novice03](https://huggingface.co/novice03).

Currently, there are 4 checkpoints, corresponding to various sequence lengths: [`nystromformer-512`](https://huggingface.co/uw-madison/nystromformer-512), [`nystromformer-1024`](https://huggingface.co/uw-madison/nystromformer-1024), [`nystromformer-2048`](https://huggingface.co/uw-madison/nystromformer-2048), and [`nystromformer-4096`](https://huggingface.co/uw-madison/nystromformer-4096).

Let\\'s take a look at a minimal example of Nyströmformer for MLM:\\n```python\\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, NystromformerForMaskedLM\\nimport torch\\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from\\\\_pretrained(\"uw-madison/nystromformer-512\")\\nmodel = NystromformerForMaskedLM.from\\\\_pretrained(\"uw-madison/nystromformer-512\")\\ninputs = tokenizer(\"Paris is the [MASK] of France.\", return\\\\_tensors=\"pt\")\\nwith torch.no\\\\_grad():\\nlogits = model(\\\\*\\\\*inputs).logits\\n# retrieve index of [MASK]\\nmask\\\\_token\\\\_index = (inputs.input\\\\_ids == tokenizer.mask\\\\_token\\\\_id)[0].nonzero(as\\\\_tuple=True)[0]\\npredicted\\\\_token\\\\_id = logits[0, mask\\\\_token\\\\_index].argmax(axis=-1)\\ntokenizer.decode(predicted\\\\_token\\\\_id)\\n```\\n\\nOutput:\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\ncapital\\n\\nAlternatively, we can use the [pipeline API](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main\\\\_classes/pipelines) (which handles all the complexity for us):\\n```python\\nfrom transformers import pipeline\\nunmasker = pipeline(\\'fill-mask\\', model=\\'uw-madison/nystromformer-512\\')\\nunmasker(\"Paris is the [MASK] of France.\")\\n```\\n\\nOutput:\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n[{\\'score\\': 0.829957902431488,\\n\\'token\\': 1030,\\n\\'token\\\\_str\\': \\'capital\\',\\n\\'sequence\\': \\'paris is the capital of france.\\'},\\n{\\'score\\': 0.022157637402415276,\\n\\'token\\': 16081,\\n\\'token\\\\_str\\': \\'birthplace\\',\\n\\'sequence\\': \\'paris is the birthplace of france.\\'},\\n{\\'score\\': 0.01904447190463543,\\n\\'token\\': 197,\\n\\'token\\\\_str\\': \\'name\\',\\n\\'sequence\\': \\'paris is the name of france.\\'},\\n{\\'score\\': 0.017583081498742104,\\n\\'token\\': 1107,\\n\\'token\\\\_str\\': \\'kingdom\\',\\n\\'sequence\\': \\'paris is the kingdom of france.\\'},\\n{\\'score\\': 0.005948934704065323,\\n\\'token\\': 148,\\n\\'token\\\\_str\\': \\'city\\',\\n\\'sequence\\': \\'paris is the city of france.\\'}]\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nNyströmformer offers an efficient approximation to the standard self-attention mechanism, while outperforming other linear self-attention schemes.

Their success can be attributed to the self-attention mechanism, which captures the pairwise interactions between all the tokens in an input. However, the standard self-attention mechanism has a time and memory complexity of \\\\\\\\(O(n^2)\\\\\\\\) (where \\\\\\\\(n\\\\\\\\) is the length of the input sequence), making it expensive to train on long input sequences. The [Nyströmformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03902) is one of many efficient Transformer models that approximates standard self-attention with \\\\\\\\(O(n)\\\\\\\\) complexity. Nyströmformer exhibits competitive performance on various downstream NLP and CV tasks while improving upon the efficiency of standard self-attention. The aim of this blog post is to give readers an overview of the Nyström method and how it can be adapted to approximate self-attention. ## Nyström method for matrix approximation\\nAt the heart of Nyströmformer is the Nyström method for matrix approximation. It allows us to approximate a matrix by sampling some of its rows and columns. Let\\'s consider a matrix \\\\\\\\(P^{n \\\\times n}\\\\\\\\), which is expensive to compute in its entirety. So, instead, we approximate it using the Nyström method. We start by sampling \\\\\\\\(m\\\\\\\\) rows and columns from \\\\\\\\(P\\\\\\\\). We can then arrange the sampled rows and columns as follows:\\n\\nRepresenting P as a block matrix\\n\\nWe now have four submatrices: \\\\\\\\(A\\\\_P, B\\\\_P, F\\\\_P,\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\(C\\\\_P\\\\\\\\), with sizes \\\\\\\\(m \\\\times m, m \\\\times (n - m), (n - m) \\\\times m\\\\\\\\) and\\n\\\\\\\\((n - m) \\\\times (n - m)\\\\\\\\) respectively. The \\\\\\\\(m\\\\\\\\) sampled columns are contained in \\\\\\\\(A\\\\_P\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\(F\\\\_P\\\\\\\\), whereas the \\\\\\\\(m\\\\\\\\) sampled rows are contained in \\\\\\\\(A\\\\_P\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\(B\\\\_P\\\\\\\\). So, the entries of \\\\\\\\(A\\\\_P, B\\\\_P,\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\(F\\\\_P\\\\\\\\) are known to us, and we will estimate \\\\\\\\(C\\\\_P\\\\\\\\). According to the Nyström method, \\\\\\\\(C\\\\_P\\\\\\\\) is given by:\\n$$C\\\\_P = F\\\\_P A\\\\_P^+ B\\\\_P$$\\nHere, \\\\\\\\(+\\\\\\\\) denotes the Moore-Penrose inverse (or pseudoinverse). Thus, the Nyström approximation of \\\\\\\\(P, \\\\hat{P}\\\\\\\\) can be written as:\\n\\nNyström approximation of P\\n\\nAs shown in the second line, \\\\\\\\(\\\\hat{P}\\\\\\\\) can be expressed as a product of three matrices.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689ab5e03e684812d15f6bcf', 'page_content': 'The abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*Transformers have emerged as a powerful tool for a broad range of natural language processing tasks. A key component\\nthat drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or\\ndependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the\\ninput sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences -- a topic being actively studied in the\\ncommunity. To address this limitation, we propose Nyströmformer -- a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a\\nfunction of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nyström method to approximate standard self-attention\\nwith O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nyströmformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of\\ntokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard\\nsequence length, and find that our Nyströmformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than\\nstandard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nyströmformer performs\\nfavorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.

For example, given the sentence:\\n> Does Chicago have any Pakistani restaurants? A named-entity recognition algorithm may identify:\\n- \"Chicago\" as a \\\\*\\\\*location\\\\*\\\\*\\n- \"Pakistani\" as an \\\\*\\\\*ethnicity\\\\*\\\\*\\nand so on. Using `gradio` (specifically the `HighlightedText` component), you can easily build a web demo of your NER model and share that with the rest of your team. Here is an example of a demo that you\\'ll be able to build:\\n$demo\\\\_ner\\\\_pipeline\\nThis tutorial will show how to take a pretrained NER model and deploy it with a Gradio interface. We will show two different ways to use the `HighlightedText` component -- depending on your NER model, either of these two ways may be easier to learn!\\n\\note: the following transcripts are associated with Merve Noyan\\'s videos in the Hugging Face Tasks playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo2EIpI\\\\_JMQtyEr-sLJSy5\\\\_SnLCb4vtQf\\nToken Classification video\\nWelcome to the Hugging Face tasks series! In this video we’ll take a look at the token classification task. Token classification is the task of assigning a label to each token in a sentence. There are various token classification tasks and the most common are Named Entity Recognition and Part-of-Speech Tagging. Let’s take a quick look at the Named Entity Recognition task. The goal of this task is to find the entities in a piece of text, such as person, location, or organization. This task is formulated as labelling each token with one class for each entity, and another class for tokens that have no entity. Another token classification task is part-of-speech tagging. The goal of this task is to label the words for a particular part of a speech, such as noun, pronoun, adjective, verb and so on. This task is formulated as labelling each token with parts of speech. Token classification models are evaluated on Accuracy, Recall, Precision and F1-Score. The metrics are calculated for each of the classes. We calculate true positive, true negative and false positives to calculate precision and recall, and take their harmonic mean to get F1-Score.', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': 'a3088c78-476d-4d03-8eef-4e1be83aad8f', 'tool_call_id': 'call_d41Y7p6eDmA2VO8cTa9dRLWx', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689ab1613e684812d15f6651', 'page_content': 'p align=\"center\"> ![FSNER LOGO](http://sayef.tech:8082/uploads/FSNER-LOGO-2.png) \\n\\nImplemented by  [sayef](https://huggingface.co/sayef) . ## Overview\\nThe FSNER model was proposed in [Example-Based Named Entity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10570) by Morteza Ziyadi, Yuting Sun, Abhishek Goswami, Jade Huang, Weizhu Chen.

In comparison with the current state-of-the-art, the proposed method performs significantly better, especially when using a low number of support examples. ## Model Training Details\\n-----\\n| identifier | epochs | datasets |\\n| ---------- |:----------:| :-----:|\\n| [sayef/fsner-bert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/sayef/fsner-bert-base-uncased) | 10 | ontonotes5, conll2003, wnut2017, and fin (Alvarado et al.). |\\n## Installation and Example Usage\\n------\\nYou can use the FSNER model in 3 ways:\\n1.

For example, given the sentence:\\n> Does Chicago have any Pakistani restaurants? A named-entity recognition algorithm may identify:\\n- \"Chicago\" as a \\\\*\\\\*location\\\\*\\\\*\\n- \"Pakistani\" as an \\\\*\\\\*ethnicity\\\\*\\\\*\\nand so on. Using `gradio` (specifically the `HighlightedText` component), you can easily build a web demo of your NER model and share that with the rest of your team. Here is an example of a demo that you\\'ll be able to build:\\n$demo\\\\_ner\\\\_pipeline\\nThis tutorial will show how to take a pretrained NER model and deploy it with a Gradio interface.

In this video we’ll take a look at the token classification task. Token classification is the task of assigning a label to each token in a sentence. There are various token classification tasks and the most common are Named Entity Recognition and Part-of-Speech Tagging. Let’s take a quick look at the Named Entity Recognition task. The goal of this task is to find the entities in a piece of text, such as person, location, or organization. This task is formulated as labelling each token with one class for each entity, and another class for tokens that have no entity. Another token classification task is part-of-speech tagging. The goal of this task is to label the words for a particular part of a speech, such as noun, pronoun, adjective, verb and so on. This task is formulated as labelling each token with parts of speech. Token classification models are evaluated on Accuracy, Recall, Precision and F1-Score. The metrics are calculated for each of the classes. We calculate true positive, true negative and false positives to calculate precision and recall, and take their harmonic mean to get F1-Score.\", 'type': 'Document'}}], 'status': 'success'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'messages', 'AIMessage'], 'kwargs': {'content': 'The goal of the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task in token classification is to find the entities in a piece of text, such as names of people, locations, or organizations.

You can give CLIP an image or a piece of text, and CLIP will output an abstract \\\\*representation\\\\* of your input. This abstract representation, also called an \\\\*embedding\\\\*, is really just a vector (a list of numbers). You can think of this vector as a point in high-dimensional space. CLIP is trained so that the representations of similar pictures and texts are similar as well. This means that if we input an image and a text description that fits that image, the representations of the image and the text will be similar (i.e., the high-dimensional points will be close together).\\n\\nIt allows a computer to not only know what is in an image (classification), where objects are in the image (detection), but also what the outlines of those objects are. Knowing the outlines of objects is essential in fields such as robotics and autonomous driving. For example, a robot has to know the shape of an object to grab it correctly. Segmentation can also be combined with [image inpainting](https://t.co/5q8YHSOfx7) to allow users to describe which part of the image they want to replace. One limitation of most image segmentation models is that they only work with a fixed list of categories. For example, you cannot simply use a segmentation model trained on oranges to segment apples. To teach the segmentation model an additional category, you have to label data of the new category and train a new model, which can be costly and time-consuming. But what if there was a model that can already segment almost any kind of object, without any further training? That’s exactly what [CLIPSeg](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10003), a zero-shot segmentation model, achieves. Currently, CLIPSeg still has its limitations.\\n\\nNow you see why CLIP was truly a breakthrough in machine learning. The reason why CLIP works so well is that the model was trained on a huge dataset of images with text captions. The dataset contained a whopping 400 million image-text pairs taken from the internet. These images contain a wide variety of objects and concepts, and CLIP is great at creating a representation for each of them. ## CLIPSeg: image segmentation with CLIP\\n[CLIPSeg](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10003) is a model that uses CLIP representations to create image segmentation masks. It was published by Timo Lüddecke and Alexander Ecker. They achieved zero-shot image segmentation by training a Transformer-based decoder on top of the CLIP model, which is kept frozen. The decoder takes in the CLIP representation of an image, and the CLIP representation of the thing you want to segment. Using these two inputs, the CLIPSeg decoder creates a binary segmentation mask. To be more precise, the decoder doesn’t only use the final CLIP representation of the image we want to segment, but it also uses the outputs of some of the layers of CLIP.

[Styling](#styling)\\n7. [Progress bars](#progress-bars)\\n8. [Batch functions](#batch-functions)\\n## Components\\nGradio includes more than 30 pre-built components (as well as many user-built \\\\_custom components\\\\_) that can be used as inputs or outputs in your demo with a single line of code. These components correspond to common data types in machine learning and data science, e.g. the `gr.Image` component is designed to handle input or output images, the `gr.Label` component displays classification labels and probabilities, the `gr.Plot` component displays various kinds of plots, and so on. Each component includes various constructor attributes that control the properties of the component. For example, you can control the number of lines in a `gr.Textbox` using the `lines` argument (which takes a positive integer) in its constructor. Or you can control the way that a user can provide an image in the `gr.Image` component using the `sources` parameter (which takes a list like `[\"webcam\", \"upload\"]`). \\\\*\\\\*Static and Interactive Components\\\\*\\\\*\\nEvery component has a \\\\_static\\\\_ version that is designed to \\\\*display\\\\* data, and most components also have an \\\\_interactive\\\\_ version designed to let users input or modify the data. Typically, you don\\'t need to think about this distinction, because when you build a Gradio demo, Gradio automatically figures out whether the component should be static or interactive based on whether it is being used as an input or output. However, you can set this manually using the `interactive` argument that every component supports. \\\\*\\\\*Preprocessing and Postprocessing\\\\*\\\\*\\nWhen a component is used as an input, Gradio automatically handles the \\\\_preprocessing\\\\_ needed to convert the data from a type sent by the user\\'s browser (such as an uploaded image) to a form that can be accepted by your function (such as a `numpy` array). Similarly, when a component is used as an output, Gradio automatically handles the \\\\_postprocessing\\\\_ needed to convert the data from what is returned by your function (such as a list of image paths) to a form that can be displayed in the user\\'s browser (a gallery of images). Consider an example demo with three input components (`gr.Textbox`, `gr.Number`, and `gr.Image`) and two outputs (`gr.Number` and `gr.Gallery`) that serve as a UI for your image-to-image generation model. Below is a diagram of what our preprocessing will send to the model and what our postprocessing will require from it. ![](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/guides/assets/dataflow.svg?raw=true)\\nIn this image, the following preprocessing steps happen to send the data from the browser to your function:\\n\\\\* The text in the textbox is converted to a Python `str` (essentially no preprocessing)\\n\\\\* The number in the number input in converted to a Python `float` (essentially no preprocessing)\\n\\\\* Most importantly, ihe image supplied by the user is converted to a `numpy.array` representation of the RGB values in the image\\nImages are converted to NumPy arrays because they are a common format for machine learning workflows. You can control the \\\\_preprocessing\\\\_ using the component\\'s parameters when constructing the component. For example, if you instantiate the `Image` component with the following parameters, it will preprocess the image to the `PIL` format instead:\\n```py\\nimg = gr.Image(type=\"pil\")\\n```\\nPostprocessing is even simpler! Gradio automatically recognizes the format of the returned data (e.g. does the user\\'s function return a `numpy` array or a `str` filepath for the `gr.Image` component?) and postprocesses it appropriately into a format that can be displayed by the browser. So in the image above, the following postprocessing steps happen to send the data returned from a user\\'s function to the browser:\\n\\\\* The `float` is displayed as a number and displayed directly to the user\\n\\\\* The list of string filepaths (`list[str]`) is interpreted as a list of image filepaths and displayed as a gallery in the browser\\nTake a look at the [Docs](https://gradio.app/docs) to see all the parameters for each Gradio component.\\n\\nGradio, check![[gradio-check]]\\nThis wraps up the chapter on building cool ML demos with Gradio - we hope you enjoyed it! To recap, in this chapter we learned:\\n- How to create Gradio demos with the high-level `Interface` API, and how to configure different input and output modalities. - Different ways to share Gradio demos, through temporary links and hosting on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces). - How to integrate Gradio demos with models and Spaces on the Hugging Face Hub. - Advanced features like storing state in a demo or providing authentication. - How to have full control of the data flow and layout of your demo with Gradio Blocks. If you\\'d like to test your understanding of the concepts covered in this chapter, check out the quiz in the next section! ## Where to next?[[where-to-next]]\\nIf you want to learn more about Gradio you can\\n- Take a look at [Demos](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/tree/main/demo) in the repo, there are quite a lot of examples there. - See the [Guides](https://gradio.app/guides/) page, where you can find guides about cool and advanced features.\\n\\n### An Overview of Gradio\\nSo far, we\\'ve been discussing the `Interface` class, which is a high-level class that lets to build demos quickly with Gradio. But what else does Gradio do? #### Chatbots with `gr.ChatInterface`\\nGradio includes another high-level class, `gr.ChatInterface`, which is specifically designed to create Chatbot UIs. Similar to `Interface`, you supply a function and Gradio creates a fully working Chatbot UI. If you\\'re interested in creating a chatbot, you can jump straight [our dedicated guide on `gr.ChatInterface`](https://www.gradio.app/guides/creating-a-chatbot-fast). #### Custom Demos with `gr.Blocks`\\nGradio also offers a low-level approach for designing web apps with more flexible layouts and data flows with the `gr.Blocks` class. Blocks allows you to do things like control where components appear on the page, handle complex data flows (e.g. outputs can serve as inputs to other functions), and update properties/visibility of components based on user interaction — still all in Python. You can build very custom and complex applications using `gr.Blocks()`. For example, the popular image generation [Automatic1111 Web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) is built using Gradio Blocks. We dive deeper into the `gr.Blocks` on our series on [building with Blocks](https://www.gradio.app/guides/blocks-and-event-listeners). #### The Gradio Python & JavaScript Ecosystem\\nThat\\'s the gist of the core `gradio` Python library, but Gradio is actually so much more!

Typically, you don\\'t need to think about this distinction, because when you build a Gradio demo, Gradio automatically figures out whether the component should be static or interactive based on whether it is being used as an input or output. However, you can set this manually using the `interactive` argument that every component supports. \\\\*\\\\*Preprocessing and Postprocessing\\\\*\\\\*\\nWhen a component is used as an input, Gradio automatically handles the \\\\_preprocessing\\\\_ needed to convert the data from a type sent by the user\\'s browser (such as an uploaded image) to a form that can be accepted by your function (such as a `numpy` array). Similarly, when a component is used as an output, Gradio automatically handles the \\\\_postprocessing\\\\_ needed to convert the data from what is returned by your function (such as a list of image paths) to a form that can be displayed in the user\\'s browser (a gallery of images). Consider an example demo with three input components (`gr.Textbox`, `gr.Number`, and `gr.Image`) and two outputs (`gr.Number` and `gr.Gallery`) that serve as a UI for your image-to-image generation model. Below is a diagram of what our preprocessing will send to the model and what our postprocessing will require from it. ![](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/guides/assets/dataflow.svg?raw=true)\\nIn this image, the following preprocessing steps happen to send the data from the browser to your function:\\n\\\\* The text in the textbox is converted to a Python `str` (essentially no preprocessing)\\n\\\\* The number in the number input in converted to a Python `float` (essentially no preprocessing)\\n\\\\* Most importantly, ihe image supplied by the user is converted to a `numpy.array` representation of the RGB values in the image\\nImages are converted to NumPy arrays because they are a common format for machine learning workflows. You can control the \\\\_preprocessing\\\\_ using the component\\'s parameters when constructing the component. For example, if you instantiate the `Image` component with the following parameters, it will preprocess the image to the `PIL` format instead:\\n```py\\nimg = gr.Image(type=\"pil\")\\n```\\nPostprocessing is even simpler! Gradio automatically recognizes the format of the returned data (e.g. does the user\\'s function return a `numpy` array or a `str` filepath for the `gr.Image` component?) and postprocesses it appropriately into a format that can be displayed by the browser. So in the image above, the following postprocessing steps happen to send the data returned from a user\\'s function to the browser:\\n\\\\* The `float` is displayed as a number and displayed directly to the user\\n\\\\* The list of string filepaths (`list[str]`) is interpreted as a list of image filepaths and displayed as a gallery in the browser\\nTake a look at the [Docs](https://gradio.app/docs) to see all the parameters for each Gradio component.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689aa93a3e684812d15f5cce', 'page_content': \"Gradio, check![[gradio-check]]\\nThis wraps up the chapter on building cool ML demos with Gradio - we hope you enjoyed it!

But what else does Gradio do? #### Chatbots with `gr.ChatInterface`\\nGradio includes another high-level class, `gr.ChatInterface`, which is specifically designed to create Chatbot UIs. Similar to `Interface`, you supply a function and Gradio creates a fully working Chatbot UI. If you're interested in creating a chatbot, you can jump straight [our dedicated guide on `gr.ChatInterface`](https://www.gradio.app/guides/creating-a-chatbot-fast). #### Custom Demos with `gr.Blocks`\\nGradio also offers a low-level approach for designing web apps with more flexible layouts and data flows with the `gr.Blocks` class. Blocks allows you to do things like control where components appear on the page, handle complex data flows (e.g. outputs can serve as inputs to other functions), and update properties/visibility of components based on user interaction — still all in Python. You can build very custom and complex applications using `gr.Blocks()`. For example, the popular image generation [Automatic1111 Web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) is built using Gradio Blocks. We dive deeper into the `gr.Blocks` on our series on [building with Blocks](https://www.gradio.app/guides/blocks-and-event-listeners). #### The Gradio Python & JavaScript Ecosystem\\nThat's the gist of the core `gradio` Python library, but Gradio is actually so much more! Its an entire ecosystem of Python and JavaScript libraries that let you build machine learning applications, or query them programmatically, in Python or JavaScript. Here are other related parts of the Gradio ecosystem:\\n\\\\* [Gradio Python Client](https://www.gradio.app/guides/getting-started-with-the-python-client) (`gradio\\\\_client`): query any Gradio app programmatically in Python. \\\\* [Gradio JavaScript Client](https://www.gradio.app/guides/getting-started-with-the-js-client) (`@gradio/client`): query any Gradio app programmatically in JavaScript. \\\\* [Gradio-Lite](https://www.gradio.app/guides/gradio-lite) (`@gradio/lite`): write Gradio apps in Python that run entirely in the browser (no server needed!), thanks to Pyodide. \\\\* [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces): the most popular place to host Gradio applications — for free!\", 'type': 'Document'}}], 'status': 'success'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'messages', 'AIMessage'], 'kwargs': {'content': 'Gradio can be used for creating interactive demos for machine learning models and applications.

Typically, PyTorch model weights are saved or \\\\*pickled\\\\* into a `.bin` file with Python\\'s [`pickle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) utility. However, `pickle` is not secure and pickled files may contain malicious code that can be executed. safetensors is a secure alternative to `pickle`, making it ideal for sharing model weights. This guide will show you how you load `.safetensor` files, and how to convert Stable Diffusion model weights stored in other formats to `.safetensor`. Before you start, make sure you have safetensors installed:\\n```py\\n# uncomment to install the necessary libraries in Colab\\n#!pip install safetensors\\n```\\nIf you look at the [`runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5`](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5/tree/main) repository, you\\'ll see weights inside the `text\\\\_encoder`, `unet` and `vae` subfolders are stored in the `.safetensors` format. By default, 🤗 Diffusers automatically loads these `.safetensors` files from their subfolders if they\\'re available in the model repository. For more explicit control, you can optionally set `use\\\\_safetensors=True` (if `safetensors` is not installed, you\\'ll get an error message asking you to install it):\\n```py\\nfrom diffusers import DiffusionPipeline\\npipeline = DiffusionPipeline.from\\\\_pretrained(\"runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5\", use\\\\_safetensors=True)\\n```\\nHowever, model weights are not necessarily stored in separate subfolders like in the example above. Sometimes, all the weights are stored in a single `.safetensors` file.

Even though Transformers started with NLP, we support multiple modalities today, for example – vision, audio, vision-language, and Reinforcement Learning. For all of these modalities, all the corresponding models from Transformers enjoy some common benefits:\\n- Easy model download with a single line of code with `from\\\\_pretrained()`\\n- Easy model upload with `push\\\\_to\\\\_hub()`\\n- Support for loading huge checkpoints with efficient checkpoint sharding techniques\\n- Optimization support (with tools like [Optimum](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum))\\n- Initialization from model configurations\\n- Support for both PyTorch and TensorFlow (non-exhaustive)\\n- and many more\\nUnlike tokenizers, we have preprocessors (such as [this](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model\\\\_doc/vit#transformers.ViTImageProcessor)) that take care of preparing data for the vision models. We have worked hard to ensure the user experience of using a vision model still feels easy and similar:\\n```py\\nfrom transformers import ViTImageProcessor, ViTForImageClassification\\nimport torch\\nfrom datasets import load\\\\_dataset\\ndataset = load\\\\_dataset(\"huggingface/cats-image\")\\nimage = dataset[\"test\"][\"image\"][0]\\nimage\\\\_processor  = ViTImageProcessor.from\\\\_pretrained(\"google/vit-base-patch16-224\")\\nmodel = ViTForImageClassification.from\\\\_pretrained(\"google/vit-base-patch16-224\")\\ninputs = image\\\\_processor(image, return\\\\_tensors=\"pt\")\\nwith torch.no\\\\_grad():\\nlogits = model(\\\\*\\\\*inputs).logits\\n# model predicts one of the 1000 ImageNet classes\\npredicted\\\\_label = logits.argmax(-1).item()\\nprint(model.config.id2label[predicted\\\\_label])\\n# Egyptian cat\\n```\\nEven for a difficult task like object detection, the user experience doesn’t change very much:\\n```py\\nfrom transformers import AutoImageProcessor, AutoModelForObjectDetection\\nfrom PIL import Image\\nimport requests\\nurl = \"http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg\"\\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\\nimage\\\\_processor = AutoImageProcessor.from\\\\_pretrained(\"microsoft/conditional-detr-resnet-50\")\\nmodel = AutoModelForObjectDetection.from\\\\_pretrained(\"microsoft/conditional-detr-resnet-50\")\\ninputs = image\\\\_processor(images=image, return\\\\_tensors=\"pt\")\\noutputs = model(\\\\*\\\\*inputs)\\n# convert outputs (bounding boxes and class logits) to COCO API\\ntarget\\\\_sizes = torch.tensor([image.size[::-1]])\\nresults = image\\\\_processor.post\\\\_process\\\\_object\\\\_detection(\\noutputs, threshold=0.5, target\\\\_sizes=target\\\\_sizes\\n)[0]\\nfor score, label, box in zip(results[\"scores\"], results[\"labels\"], results[\"boxes\"]):\\nbox = [round(i, 2) for i in box.tolist()]\\nprint(\\nf\"Detected {model.config.id2label[label.item()]} with confidence \"\\nf\"{round(score.item(), 3)} at location {box}\"\\n)\\n```\\nLeads to:\\n```bash\\nDetected remote with confidence 0.833 at location [38.31, 72.1, 177.63, 118.45]\\nDetected cat with confidence 0.831 at location [9.2, 51.38, 321.13, 469.0]\\nDetected cat with confidence 0.804 at location [340.3, 16.85, 642.93, 370.95]\\nDetected remote with confidence 0.683 at location [334.48, 73.49, 366.37, 190.01]\\nDetected couch with confidence 0.535 at location [0.52, 1.19, 640.35, 475.1]\\n```\\n## Zero-shot models for vision\\nThere’s been a surge of models that reformulate core vision tasks like segmentation and detection in interesting ways and introduce even more flexibility.\\n\\n--\\ntitle: The State of Computer Vision at Hugging Face 🤗\\nthumbnail: /blog/assets/cv\\\\_state/thumbnail.png\\nauthors:\\n- user: sayakpaul\\n---\\n# The State of Computer Vision at Hugging Face 🤗\\nAt Hugging Face, we pride ourselves on democratizing the field of artificial intelligence together with the community. As a part of that mission, we began focusing our efforts on computer vision over the last year. What started as a [PR for having Vision Transformers (ViT) in 🤗 Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/10950) has now grown into something much bigger – 8 core vision tasks, over 3000 models, and over 100 datasets on the Hugging Face Hub. A lot of exciting things have happened since ViTs joined the Hub. In this blog post, we’ll summarize what went down and what’s coming to support the continuous progress of Computer Vision from the 🤗 ecosystem. Here is a list of things we’ll cover:\\n- [Supported vision tasks and Pipelines](#support-for-pipelines)\\n- [Training your own vision models](#training-your-own-models)\\n- [Integration with `timm`](#🤗-🤝-timm)\\n- [Diffusers](#🧨-diffusers)\\n- [Support for third-party libraries](#support-for-third-party-libraries)\\n- [Deployment](#deployment)\\n- and much more! ## Enabling the community: One task at a time 👁\\nThe Hugging Face Hub is home to over 100,000 public models for different tasks such as next-word prediction, mask filling, token classification, sequence classification, and so on. As of today, we support [8 core vision tasks](https://huggingface.co/tasks) providing many model checkpoints:\\n- Image classification\\n- Image segmentation\\n- (Zero-shot) object detection\\n- Video classification\\n- Depth estimation\\n- Image-to-image synthesis\\n- Unconditional image generation\\n- Zero-shot image classification\\nEach of these tasks comes with at least 10 model checkpoints on the Hub for you to explore. Furthermore, we support [tasks](https://huggingface.co/tasks) that lie at the intersection of vision and language such as:\\n- Image-to-text (image captioning, OCR)\\n- Text-to-image\\n- Document question-answering\\n- Visual question-answering\\nThese tasks entail not only state-of-the-art Transformer-based architectures such as [ViT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model\\\\_doc/vit), [Swin](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model\\\\_doc/swin), [DETR](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model\\\\_doc/detr) but also \\\\*pure convolutional\\\\* architectures like [ConvNeXt](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model\\\\_doc/convnext), [ResNet](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model\\\\_doc/resnet), [RegNet](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model\\\\_doc/regnet), and more! Architectures like ResNets are still very much relevant for a myriad of industrial use cases and hence the support of these non-Transformer architectures in 🤗 Transformers. It’s also important to note that the models on the Hub are not just from the Transformers library but also from other third-party libraries. For example, even though we support tasks like unconditional image generation on the Hub, we don’t have any models supporting that task in Transformers yet (such as [this](https://huggingface.co/ceyda/butterfly\\\\_cropped\\\\_uniq1K\\\\_512)). Supporting all ML tasks, whether they are solved with Transformers or a third-party library is a part of our mission to foster a collaborative open-source Machine Learning ecosystem. ## Support for Pipelines\\nWe developed [Pipelines](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main\\\\_classes/pipelines) to equip practitioners with the tools they need to easily incorporate machine learning into their toolbox. They provide an easy way to perform inference on a given input with respect to a task. We have support for [seven vision tasks](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main\\\\_classes/pipelines#computer-vision) in Pipelines. Here is an example of using Pipelines for depth estimation:\\n```py\\nfrom transformers import pipeline\\ndepth\\\\_estimator = pipeline(task=\"depth-estimation\", model=\"Intel/dpt-large\")\\noutput = depth\\\\_estimator(\"http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg\")\\n# This is a tensor with the values being the depth expressed\\n# in meters for each pixel\\noutput[\"depth\"]\\n```\\n\\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/cv_state/depth_estimation_output.png)\\n\\nThe interface remains the same even for tasks like visual question-answering:\\n```py\\nfrom transformers import pipeline\\noracle = pipeline(model=\"dandelin/vilt-b32-finetuned-vqa\")\\nimage\\\\_url = \"https://huggingface.co/datasets/mishig/sample\\\\_images/resolve/main/tiger.jpg\"\\noracle(question=\"What\\'s the animal doing?\", image=image\\\\_url, top\\\\_k=1)\\n# [{\\'score\\': 0.778620, \\'answer\\': \\'laying down\\'}]\\n```\\n## Training your own models\\nWhile being able to use a model for off-the-shelf inference is a great way to get started, fine-tuning is where the community gets the most benefits.', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': '12829664-1121-421b-929a-87b790100114', 'tool_call_id': 'call_rMi3Saa46Bz7dJFzmPIWXCvl', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689ab93f3e684812d15f6f88', 'page_content': \"--\\ntitle: Image Classification with AutoTrain\\nthumbnail: /blog/assets/105\\\\_autotrain-image-classification/thumbnail.png\\nauthors:\\n- user: nimaboscarino\\n---\\n# Image Classification with AutoTrain\\nSo you’ve heard all about the cool things that are happening in the machine learning world, and you want to join in.

We have worked hard to ensure the user experience of using a vision model still feels easy and similar:\\n```py\\nfrom transformers import ViTImageProcessor, ViTForImageClassification\\nimport torch\\nfrom datasets import load\\\\_dataset\\ndataset = load\\\\_dataset(\"huggingface/cats-image\")\\nimage = dataset[\"test\"][\"image\"][0]\\nimage\\\\_processor  = ViTImageProcessor.from\\\\_pretrained(\"google/vit-base-patch16-224\")\\nmodel = ViTForImageClassification.from\\\\_pretrained(\"google/vit-base-patch16-224\")\\ninputs = image\\\\_processor(image, return\\\\_tensors=\"pt\")\\nwith torch.no\\\\_grad():\\nlogits = model(\\\\*\\\\*inputs).logits\\n# model predicts one of the 1000 ImageNet classes\\npredicted\\\\_label = logits.argmax(-1).item()\\nprint(model.config.id2label[predicted\\\\_label])\\n# Egyptian cat\\n```\\nEven for a difficult task like object detection, the user experience doesn’t change very much:\\n```py\\nfrom transformers import AutoImageProcessor, AutoModelForObjectDetection\\nfrom PIL import Image\\nimport requests\\nurl = \"http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg\"\\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\\nimage\\\\_processor = AutoImageProcessor.from\\\\_pretrained(\"microsoft/conditional-detr-resnet-50\")\\nmodel = AutoModelForObjectDetection.from\\\\_pretrained(\"microsoft/conditional-detr-resnet-50\")\\ninputs = image\\\\_processor(images=image, return\\\\_tensors=\"pt\")\\noutputs = model(\\\\*\\\\*inputs)\\n# convert outputs (bounding boxes and class logits) to COCO API\\ntarget\\\\_sizes = torch.tensor([image.size[::-1]])\\nresults = image\\\\_processor.post\\\\_process\\\\_object\\\\_detection(\\noutputs, threshold=0.5, target\\\\_sizes=target\\\\_sizes\\n)[0]\\nfor score, label, box in zip(results[\"scores\"], results[\"labels\"], results[\"boxes\"]):\\nbox = [round(i, 2) for i in box.tolist()]\\nprint(\\nf\"Detected {model.config.id2label[label.item()]} with confidence \"\\nf\"{round(score.item(), 3)} at location {box}\"\\n)\\n```\\nLeads to:\\n```bash\\nDetected remote with confidence 0.833 at location [38.31, 72.1, 177.63, 118.45]\\nDetected cat with confidence 0.831 at location [9.2, 51.38, 321.13, 469.0]\\nDetected cat with confidence 0.804 at location [340.3, 16.85, 642.93, 370.95]\\nDetected remote with confidence 0.683 at location [334.48, 73.49, 366.37, 190.01]\\nDetected couch with confidence 0.535 at location [0.52, 1.19, 640.35, 475.1]\\n```\\n## Zero-shot models for vision\\nThere’s been a surge of models that reformulate core vision tasks like segmentation and detection in interesting ways and introduce even more flexibility.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '6899bf06666af48523f51d5e', 'page_content': '--\\ntitle: The State of Computer Vision at Hugging Face 🤗\\nthumbnail: /blog/assets/cv\\\\_state/thumbnail.png\\nauthors:\\n- user: sayakpaul\\n---\\n# The State of Computer Vision at Hugging Face 🤗\\nAt Hugging Face, we pride ourselves on democratizing the field of artificial intelligence together with the community. As a part of that mission, we began focusing our efforts on computer vision over the last year. What started as a [PR for having Vision Transformers (ViT) in 🤗 Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/10950) has now grown into something much bigger – 8 core vision tasks, over 3000 models, and over 100 datasets on the Hugging Face Hub. A lot of exciting things have happened since ViTs joined the Hub. In this blog post, we’ll summarize what went down and what’s coming to support the continuous progress of Computer Vision from the 🤗 ecosystem. Here is a list of things we’ll cover:\\n- [Supported vision tasks and Pipelines](#support-for-pipelines)\\n- [Training your own vision models](#training-your-own-models)\\n- [Integration with `timm`](#🤗-🤝-timm)\\n- [Diffusers](#🧨-diffusers)\\n- [Support for third-party libraries](#support-for-third-party-libraries)\\n- [Deployment](#deployment)\\n- and much more! ## Enabling the community: One task at a time 👁\\nThe Hugging Face Hub is home to over 100,000 public models for different tasks such as next-word prediction, mask filling, token classification, sequence classification, and so on. As of today, we support [8 core vision tasks](https://huggingface.co/tasks) providing many model checkpoints:\\n- Image classification\\n- Image segmentation\\n- (Zero-shot) object detection\\n- Video classification\\n- Depth estimation\\n- Image-to-image synthesis\\n- Unconditional image generation\\n- Zero-shot image classification\\nEach of these tasks comes with at least 10 model checkpoints on the Hub for you to explore. Furthermore, we support [tasks](https://huggingface.co/tasks) that lie at the intersection of vision and language such as:\\n- Image-to-text (image captioning, OCR)\\n- Text-to-image\\n- Document question-answering\\n- Visual question-answering\\nThese tasks entail not only state-of-the-art Transformer-based architectures such as [ViT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model\\\\_doc/vit), [Swin](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model\\\\_doc/swin), [DETR](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model\\\\_doc/detr) but also \\\\*pure convolutional\\\\* architectures like [ConvNeXt](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model\\\\_doc/convnext), [ResNet](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model\\\\_doc/resnet), [RegNet](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model\\\\_doc/regnet), and more! Architectures like ResNets are still very much relevant for a myriad of industrial use cases and hence the support of these non-Transformer architectures in 🤗 Transformers. It’s also important to note that the models on the Hub are not just from the Transformers library but also from other third-party libraries. For example, even though we support tasks like unconditional image generation on the Hub, we don’t have any models supporting that task in Transformers yet (such as [this](https://huggingface.co/ceyda/butterfly\\\\_cropped\\\\_uniq1K\\\\_512)). Supporting all ML tasks, whether they are solved with Transformers or a third-party library is a part of our mission to foster a collaborative open-source Machine Learning ecosystem. ## Support for Pipelines\\nWe developed [Pipelines](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main\\\\_classes/pipelines) to equip practitioners with the tools they need to easily incorporate machine learning into their toolbox. They provide an easy way to perform inference on a given input with respect to a task. We have support for [seven vision tasks](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main\\\\_classes/pipelines#computer-vision) in Pipelines. Here is an example of using Pipelines for depth estimation:\\n```py\\nfrom transformers import pipeline\\ndepth\\\\_estimator = pipeline(task=\"depth-estimation\", model=\"Intel/dpt-large\")\\noutput = depth\\\\_estimator(\"http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg\")\\n# This is a tensor with the values being the depth expressed\\n# in meters for each pixel\\noutput[\"depth\"]\\n```\\n\\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/cv_state/depth_estimation_output.png)\\n\\nThe interface remains the same even for tasks like visual question-answering:\\n```py\\nfrom transformers import pipeline\\noracle = pipeline(model=\"dandelin/vilt-b32-finetuned-vqa\")\\nimage\\\\_url = \"https://huggingface.co/datasets/mishig/sample\\\\_images/resolve/main/tiger.jpg\"\\noracle(question=\"What\\'s the animal doing?\", image=image\\\\_url, top\\\\_k=1)\\n# [{\\'score\\': 0.778620, \\'answer\\': \\'laying down\\'}]\\n```\\n## Training your own models\\nWhile being able to use a model for off-the-shelf inference is a great way to get started, fine-tuning is where the community gets the most benefits.', 'type': 'Document'}}], 'status': 'success'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'messages', 'AIMessage'], 'kwargs': {'content': 'The latest task added to Hugging Face AutoTrain for Computer Vision is **image classification**.', 'response_metadata': {'finish_reason': 'stop', 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_34a54ae93c'}, 'type': 'ai', 'id': 'run--4f65c5d5-bd2f-4839-8fda-be89f9e4d89f-0', 'usage_metadata': {'input_tokens': 2869, 'output_tokens': 19, 'total_tokens': 2888, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}, 'tool_calls': [], 'invalid_tool_calls': []}}], 'chat_history': []}\n"

If you like, you can specify which organization the repository should belong to using the `organization` argument:\\n```py\\nfrom huggingface\\\\_hub import create\\\\_repo\\ncreate\\\\_repo(\"dummy-model\", organization=\"huggingface\")\\n```\\nThis will create the `dummy-model` repository in the `huggingface` namespace, assuming you belong to that organization.\\n\\n!--⚠️ Note that this file is in Markdown but contain specific syntax for our doc-builder (similar to MDX) that may not be\\nrendered properly in your Markdown viewer. -->\\n# 创建和管理存储库\\nHugging Face Hub是一组 Git 存储库。[Git](https://git-scm.com/)是软件开发中广泛使用的工具，可以在协作工作时轻松对项目进行版本控制。本指南将向您展示如何与 Hub 上的存储库进行交互，特别关注以下内容：\\n- 创建和删除存储库\\n- 管理分支和标签\\n- 重命名您的存储库\\n- 更新您的存储库可见性\\n- 管理存储库的本地副本\\n如果您习惯于使用类似于GitLab/GitHub/Bitbucket等平台，您可能首先想到使用 `git`命令行工具来克隆存储库（`git clone`）、提交更改（`git add` , ` git commit`）并推送它们（`git push`）。在使用 Hugging Face Hub 时，这是有效的。然而，软件工程和机器学习并不具有相同的要求和工作流程。模型存储库可能会维护大量模型权重文件以适应不同的框架和工具，因此克隆存储库会导致您维护大量占用空间的本地文件夹。因此，使用我们的自定义HTTP方法可能更有效。您可以阅读我们的[git与HTTP相比较](../concepts/git\\\\_vs\\\\_http)解释页面以获取更多详细信息\\n如果你想在Hub上创建和管理一个仓库，你的计算机必须处于登录状态。如果尚未登录，请参考[此部分](../quick-start#login)。在本指南的其余部分，我们将假设你的计算机已登录\\n## 仓库创建和删除\\n第一步是了解如何创建和删除仓库。你只能管理你拥有的仓库（在你的用户名命名空间下）或者你具有写入权限的组织中的仓库\\n### 创建一个仓库\\n使用 [`create\\\\_repo`] 创建一个空仓库，并通过 `repo\\\\_id`参数为其命名 `repo\\\\_id`是你的命名空间，后面跟着仓库名称：`username\\\\_or\\\\_org/repo\\\\_name`\\n运行以下代码，以创建仓库：\\n```py\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import create\\\\_repo\\n>>> create\\\\_repo(\"lysandre/test-model\")\\n\\'https://huggingface.co/lysandre/test-model\\'\\n```\\n默认情况下，[`create\\\\_repo`] 会创建一个模型仓库。但是你可以使用 `repo\\\\_type`参数来指定其他仓库类型。例如，如果你想创建一个数据集仓库\\n请运行以下代码：\\n```py\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import create\\\\_repo\\n>>> create\\\\_repo(\"lysandre/test-dataset\", repo\\\\_type=\"dataset\")\\n\\'https://huggingface.co/datasets/lysandre/test-dataset\\'\\n```\\n创建仓库时，你可以使用 `private`参数设置仓库的可见性\\n请运行以下代码\\n```py\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import create\\\\_repo\\n>>> create\\\\_repo(\"lysandre/test-private\", private=True)\\n```\\n如果你想在以后更改仓库的可见性，你可以使用[`update\\\\_repo\\\\_visibility`] 函数\\n### 删除一个仓库\\n使用 [`delete\\\\_repo`] 删除一个仓库。确保你确实想要删除仓库，因为这是一个不可逆转的过程！做完上述过程后，指定你想要删除的仓库的 `repo\\\\_id`\\n请运行以下代码：\\n```py\\n>>> delete\\\\_repo(repo\\\\_id=\"lysandre/my-corrupted-dataset\", repo\\\\_type=\"dataset\")\\n```\\n### 克隆一个仓库（仅适用于 Spaces）\\n在某些情况下，你可能想要复制别人的仓库并根据自己的用例进行调整。对于 Spaces，你可以使用 [`duplicate\\\\_space`] 方法来实现。它将复制整个仓库。\\n你仍然需要配置自己的设置（硬件和密钥）。查看我们的[管理你的Space指南](./manage-spaces)以获取更多详细信息。\\n请运行以下代码：\\n```py\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import duplicate\\\\_space\\n>>> duplicate\\\\_space(\"multimodalart/dreambooth-training\", private=False)\\nRepoUrl(\\'https://huggingface.co/spaces/nateraw/dreambooth-training\\',...)\\n```\\n## 上传和下载文件\\n既然您已经创建了您的存储库，您现在也可以推送更改至其中并从中下载文件\\n这两个主题有它们自己的指南。请[上传指南](./upload) 和[下载指南](./download)来学习如何使用您的存储库。\\n## 分支和标签\\nGit存储库通常使用分支来存储同一存储库的不同版本。标签也可以用于标记存储库的特定状态，例如，在发布版本这个情况下。更一般地说，分支和标签被称为[git引用](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References). ### 创建分支和标签\\n你可以使用[`create\\\\_branch`]和[`create\\\\_tag`]来创建新的分支和标签:\\n请运行以下代码：\\n```py\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import create\\\\_branch, create\\\\_tag\\n# Create a branch on a Space repo from `main` branch\\n>>> create\\\\_branch(\"Matthijs/speecht5-tts-demo\", repo\\\\_type=\"space\", branch=\"handle-dog-speaker\")\\n# Create a tag on a Dataset repo from `v0.1-release` branch\\n>>> create\\\\_branch(\"bigcode/the-stack\", repo\\\\_type=\"dataset\", revision=\"v0.1-release\", tag=\"v0.1.1\", tag\\\\_message=\"Bump release version.\")\\n```\\n同时,你可以以相同的方式使用 [`delete\\\\_branch`] 和 [`delete\\\\_tag`] 函数来删除分支或标签\\n### 列出所有的分支和标签\\n你还可以使用 [`list\\\\_repo\\\\_refs`] 列出存储库中的现有 Git 引用\\n请运行以下代码：\\n```py\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import list\\\\_repo\\\\_refs\\n>>> api.list\\\\_repo\\\\_refs(\"bigcode/the-stack\", repo\\\\_type=\"dataset\")\\nGitRefs(\\nbranches=[\\nGitRefInfo(name=\\'main\\', ref=\\'refs/heads/main\\', target\\\\_commit=\\'18edc1591d9ce72aa82f56c4431b3c969b210ae3\\'),\\nGitRefInfo(name=\\'v1.1.a1\\', ref=\\'refs/heads/v1.1.a1\\', target\\\\_commit=\\'f9826b862d1567f3822d3d25649b0d6d22ace714\\')\\n],\\nconverts=[],\\ntags=[\\nGitRefInfo(name=\\'v1.0\\', ref=\\'refs/tags/v1.0\\', target\\\\_commit=\\'c37a8cd1e382064d8aced5e05543c5f7753834da\\')\\n]\\n)\\n```\\n## 修改存储库设置\\n存储库具有一些可配置的设置。大多数情况下，您通常会在浏览器中的存储库设置页面上手动配置这些设置。要配置存储库，您必须具有对其的写访问权限（拥有它或属于组织）。在本节中，我们将看到您还可以使用 `huggingface\\\\_hub` 在编程方式上配置的设置。\\n一些设置是特定于 Spaces（硬件、环境变量等）的。要配置这些设置，请参考我们的[管理Spaces](../guides/manage-spaces)指南。\\n### 更新可见性\\n一个存储库可以是公共的或私有的。私有存储库仅对您或存储库所在组织的成员可见。\\n请运行以下代码将存储库更改为私有：\\n```py\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import update\\\\_repo\\\\_visibility\\n>>> update\\\\_repo\\\\_visibility(repo\\\\_id=repo\\\\_id, private=True)\\n```\\n### 重命名您的存储库\\n您可以使用 [`move\\\\_repo`] 在 Hub 上重命名您的存储库。使用这种方法，您还可以将存储库从一个用户移动到一个组织。在这样做时，有一些[限制](https://hf.co/docs/hub/repositories-settings#renaming-or-transferring-a-repo)需要注意。例如，您不能将存储库转移到另一个用户。\\n请运行以下代码：\\n```py\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import move\\\\_repo\\n>>> move\\\\_repo(from\\\\_id=\"Wauplin/cool-model\", to\\\\_id=\"huggingface/cool-model\")\\n```\\n## 管理存储库的本地副本\\n上述所有操作都可以通过HTTP请求完成。然而，在某些情况下，您可能希望在本地拥有存储库的副本，并使用您熟悉的Git命令与之交互。\\n[`Repository`] 类允许您使用类似于Git命令的函数与Hub上的文件和存储库进行交互。它是对Git和Git-LFS方法的包装，以使用您已经了解和喜爱的Git命令。在开始之前，请确保已安装Git-LFS（请参阅[此处](https://git-lfs.github.com/)获取安装说明）。\\n### 使用本地存储库\\n使用本地存储库路径实例化一个 [`Repository`] 对象：\\n请运行以下代码：\\n```py\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import Repository\\n>>> repo = Repository(local\\\\_dir=\"//\")\\n```\\n### 克隆\\n`clone\\\\_from`参数将一个存储库从Hugging Face存储库ID克隆到由 `local\\\\_dir`参数指定的本地目录：\\n请运行以下代码：\\n```py\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import Repository\\n>>> repo = Repository(local\\\\_dir=\"w2v2\", clone\\\\_from=\"facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60\")\\n```\\n`clone\\\\_from`还可以使用URL克隆存储库：\\n请运行以下代码：\\n```py\\n>>> repo = Repository(local\\\\_dir=\"huggingface-hub\", clone\\\\_from=\"https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60\")\\n```\\n你可以将`clone\\\\_from`参数与[`create\\\\_repo`]结合使用，以创建并克隆一个存储库：\\n请运行以下代码：\\n```py\\n>>> repo\\\\_url = create\\\\_repo(repo\\\\_id=\"repo\\\\_name\")\\n>>> repo = Repository(local\\\\_dir=\"repo\\\\_local\\\\_path\", clone\\\\_from=repo\\\\_url)\\n```\\n当你克隆一个存储库时，通过在克隆时指定`git\\\\_user`和`git\\\\_email`参数，你还可以为克隆的存储库配置Git用户名和电子邮件。当用户提交到该存储库时，Git将知道提交的作者是谁。\\n请运行以下代码：\\n```py\\n>>> repo = Repository(\\n...\\n\\nThere are three kinds of repositories on the Hub, and in this guide you\\'ll be creating a \\\\*\\\\*model repository\\\\*\\\\* for demonstration purposes. For information on creating and managing models, datasets, and Spaces, refer to their respective documentation. 1. To create a new repository, visit [huggingface.co/new](http://huggingface.co/new):\\n\\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/new_repo.png)\\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/new_repo-dark.png)\\n\\n2. Specify the owner of the repository: this can be either you or any of the organizations you’re affiliated with. 3. Enter your model’s name. This will also be the name of the repository. 4. Specify whether you want your model to be public or private. 5. Specify the license. You can leave the \\\\*License\\\\* field blank for now. To learn about licenses, visit the [\\\\*\\\\*Licenses\\\\*\\\\*](repositories-licenses) documentation. After creating your model repository, you should see a page like this:\\n\\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/empty_repo.png)\\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/empty_repo-dark.png)\\n\\nNote that the Hub prompts you to create a \\\\*Model Card\\\\*, which you can learn about in the [\\\\*\\\\*Model Cards documentation\\\\*\\\\*](./model-cards). Including a Model Card in your model repo is best practice, but since we\\'re only making a test repo at the moment we can skip this. ## Adding files to a repository (Web UI)\\nTo add files to your repository via the web UI, start by selecting the \\\\*\\\\*Files\\\\*\\\\* tab, navigating to the desired directory, and then clicking \\\\*\\\\*Add file\\\\*\\\\*. You\\'ll be given the option to create a new file or upload a file directly from your computer. ![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/repositories-add_file.png)\\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/repositories-add_file-dark.png)\\n\\n### Creating a new file\\nChoosing to create a new file will take you to the following editor screen, where you can choose a name for your file, add content, and save your file with a message that summarizes your changes. Instead of directly committing the new file to your repo\\'s `main` branch, you can select `Open as a pull request` to create a [Pull Request](./repositories-pull-requests-discussions). ![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/repositories-create_file.png)\\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/repositories-create_file-dark.png)\\n\\n### Uploading a file\\nIf you choose \\\\_Upload file\\\\_ you\\'ll be able to choose a local file to upload, along with a message summarizing your changes to the repo. ![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/repositories-upload_file.png)\\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/repositories-upload_file-dark.png)\\n\\nAs with creating new files, you can select `Open as a pull request` to create a [Pull Request](./repositories-pull-requests-discussions) instead of adding your changes directly to the `main` branch of your repo. ## Adding files to a repository (terminal)[[terminal]]\\n### Cloning repositories\\nDownloading repositories to your local machine is called \\\\*cloning\\\\*. You can use the following commands to load your repo and navigate to it:\\n```bash\\ngit clone https://huggingface.co//\\ncd \\n```\\nYou can clone over SSH with the following command:\\n```bash\\ngit clone git@hf.co:/\\ncd \\n```\\nYou\\'ll need to add your SSH public key to [your user settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/keys) to push changes or access private repositories. ### Set up\\nNow\\'s the time, you can add any files you want to the repository! 🔥\\nDo you have files larger than 10MB? Those files should be tracked with `git-lfs`, which you can initialize with:\\n```bash\\ngit lfs install\\n```\\nNote that if your files are larger than \\\\*\\\\*5GB\\\\*\\\\* you\\'ll also need to run:\\n```bash\\nhuggingface-cli lfs-enable-largefiles . ```\\nWhen you use Hugging Face to create a repository, Hugging Face automatically provides a list of common file extensions for common Machine Learning large files in the `.gitattributes` file, which `git-lfs` uses to efficiently track changes to your large files.', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': 'f3e03afa-ab00-4036-badb-74a472bd12d6', 'tool_call_id': 'call_jCXxwjF6umAKOQsr9YgytOAt', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '6899b46caf3d2ebb270a01b3', 'page_content': 'Firstly, there are a few methods to manage repository creation, deletion, and others:\\n```python no-format\\nfrom huggingface\\\\_hub import (\\n# User management\\nlogin,\\nlogout,\\nwhoami,\\n# Repository creation and management\\ncreate\\\\_repo,\\ndelete\\\\_repo,\\nupdate\\\\_repo\\\\_visibility,\\n# And some methods to retrieve/change information about the content\\nlist\\\\_models,\\nlist\\\\_datasets,\\nlist\\\\_metrics,\\nlist\\\\_repo\\\\_files,\\nupload\\\\_file,\\ndelete\\\\_file,\\n)\\n```\\nAdditionally, it offers the very powerful `Repository` class to manage a local repository.

存储库。[Git](https://git-scm.com/)是软件开发中广泛使用的工具，可以在协作工作时轻松对项目进行版本控制。本指南将向您展示如何与 Hub 上的存储库进行交互，特别关注以下内容：\\n- 创建和删除存储库\\n- 管理分支和标签\\n- 重命名您的存储库\\n- 更新您的存储库可见性\\n- 管理存储库的本地副本\\n如果您习惯于使用类似于GitLab/GitHub/Bitbucket等平台，您可能首先想到使用 `git`命令行工具来克隆存储库（`git clone`）、提交更改（`git add` , ` git commit`）并推送它们（`git push`）。在使用 Hugging Face Hub 时，这是有效的。然而，软件工程和机器学习并不具有相同的要求和工作流程。模型存储库可能会维护大量模型权重文件以适应不同的框架和工具，因此克隆存储库会导致您维护大量占用空间的本地文件夹。因此，使用我们的自定义HTTP方法可能更有效。您可以阅读我们的[git与HTTP相比较](../concepts/git\\\\_vs\\\\_http)解释页面以获取更多详细信息\\n如果你想在Hub上创建和管理一个仓库，你的计算机必须处于登录状态。如果尚未登录，请参考[此部分](../quick-start#login)。在本指南的其余部分，我们将假设你的计算机已登录\\n## 仓库创建和删除\\n第一步是了解如何创建和删除仓库。你只能管理你拥有的仓库（在你的用户名命名空间下）或者你具有写入权限的组织中的仓库\\n### 创建一个仓库\\n使用 [`create\\\\_repo`] 创建一个空仓库，并通过 `repo\\\\_id`参数为其命名 `repo\\\\_id`是你的命名空间，后面跟着仓库名称：`username\\\\_or\\\\_org/repo\\\\_name`\\n运行以下代码，以创建仓库：\\n```py\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import create\\\\_repo\\n>>> create\\\\_repo(\"lysandre/test-model\")\\n\\'https://huggingface.co/lysandre/test-model\\'\\n```\\n默认情况下，[`create\\\\_repo`] 会创建一个模型仓库。但是你可以使用 `repo\\\\_type`参数来指定其他仓库类型。例如，如果你想创建一个数据集仓库\\n请运行以下代码：\\n```py\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import create\\\\_repo\\n>>> create\\\\_repo(\"lysandre/test-dataset\", repo\\\\_type=\"dataset\")\\n\\'https://huggingface.co/datasets/lysandre/test-dataset\\'\\n```\\n创建仓库时，你可以使用 `private`参数设置仓库的可见性\\n请运行以下代码\\n```py\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import create\\\\_repo\\n>>> create\\\\_repo(\"lysandre/test-private\", private=True)\\n```\\n如果你想在以后更改仓库的可见性，你可以使用[`update\\\\_repo\\\\_visibility`] 函数\\n### 删除一个仓库\\n使用 [`delete\\\\_repo`] 删除一个仓库。确保你确实想要删除仓库，因为这是一个不可逆转的过程！做完上述过程后，指定你想要删除的仓库的 `repo\\\\_id`\\n请运行以下代码：\\n```py\\n>>> delete\\\\_repo(repo\\\\_id=\"lysandre/my-corrupted-dataset\", repo\\\\_type=\"dataset\")\\n```\\n### 克隆一个仓库（仅适用于 Spaces）\\n在某些情况下，你可能想要复制别人的仓库并根据自己的用例进行调整。对于 Spaces，你可以使用 [`duplicate\\\\_space`] 方法来实现。它将复制整个仓库。\\n你仍然需要配置自己的设置（硬件和密钥）。查看我们的[管理你的Space指南](./manage-spaces)以获取更多详细信息。\\n请运行以下代码：\\n```py\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import duplicate\\\\_space\\n>>> duplicate\\\\_space(\"multimodalart/dreambooth-training\", private=False)\\nRepoUrl(\\'https://huggingface.co/spaces/nateraw/dreambooth-training\\',...)\\n```\\n## 上传和下载文件\\n既然您已经创建了您的存储库，您现在也可以推送更改至其中并从中下载文件\\n这两个主题有它们自己的指南。请[上传指南](./upload) 和[下载指南](./download)来学习如何使用您的存储库。\\n## 分支和标签\\nGit存储库通常使用分支来存储同一存储库的不同版本。标签也可以用于标记存储库的特定状态，例如，在发布版本这个情况下。更一般地说，分支和标签被称为[git引用](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References). ### 创建分支和标签\\n你可以使用[`create\\\\_branch`]和[`create\\\\_tag`]来创建新的分支和标签:\\n请运行以下代码：\\n```py\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import create\\\\_branch, create\\\\_tag\\n# Create a branch on a Space repo from `main` branch\\n>>> create\\\\_branch(\"Matthijs/speecht5-tts-demo\", repo\\\\_type=\"space\", branch=\"handle-dog-speaker\")\\n# Create a tag on a Dataset repo from `v0.1-release` branch\\n>>> create\\\\_branch(\"bigcode/the-stack\", repo\\\\_type=\"dataset\", revision=\"v0.1-release\", tag=\"v0.1.1\", tag\\\\_message=\"Bump release version.\")\\n```\\n同时,你可以以相同的方式使用 [`delete\\\\_branch`] 和 [`delete\\\\_tag`] 函数来删除分支或标签\\n### 列出所有的分支和标签\\n你还可以使用 [`list\\\\_repo\\\\_refs`] 列出存储库中的现有 Git 引用\\n请运行以下代码：\\n```py\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import list\\\\_repo\\\\_refs\\n>>> api.list\\\\_repo\\\\_refs(\"bigcode/the-stack\", repo\\\\_type=\"dataset\")\\nGitRefs(\\nbranches=[\\nGitRefInfo(name=\\'main\\', ref=\\'refs/heads/main\\', target\\\\_commit=\\'18edc1591d9ce72aa82f56c4431b3c969b210ae3\\'),\\nGitRefInfo(name=\\'v1.1.a1\\', ref=\\'refs/heads/v1.1.a1\\', target\\\\_commit=\\'f9826b862d1567f3822d3d25649b0d6d22ace714\\')\\n],\\nconverts=[],\\ntags=[\\nGitRefInfo(name=\\'v1.0\\', ref=\\'refs/tags/v1.0\\', target\\\\_commit=\\'c37a8cd1e382064d8aced5e05543c5f7753834da\\')\\n]\\n)\\n```\\n## 修改存储库设置\\n存储库具有一些可配置的设置。大多数情况下，您通常会在浏览器中的存储库设置页面上手动配置这些设置。要配置存储库，您必须具有对其的写访问权限（拥有它或属于组织）。在本节中，我们将看到您还可以使用 `huggingface\\\\_hub` 在编程方式上配置的设置。\\n一些设置是特定于 Spaces（硬件、环境变量等）的。要配置这些设置，请参考我们的[管理Spaces](../guides/manage-spaces)指南。\\n### 更新可见性\\n一个存储库可以是公共的或私有的。私有存储库仅对您或存储库所在组织的成员可见。\\n请运行以下代码将存储库更改为私有：\\n```py\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import update\\\\_repo\\\\_visibility\\n>>> update\\\\_repo\\\\_visibility(repo\\\\_id=repo\\\\_id, private=True)\\n```\\n### 重命名您的存储库\\n您可以使用 [`move\\\\_repo`] 在 Hub 上重命名您的存储库。使用这种方法，您还可以将存储库从一个用户移动到一个组织。在这样做时，有一些[限制](https://hf.co/docs/hub/repositories-settings#renaming-or-transferring-a-repo)需要注意。例如，您不能将存储库转移到另一个用户。\\n请运行以下代码：\\n```py\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import move\\\\_repo\\n>>> move\\\\_repo(from\\\\_id=\"Wauplin/cool-model\", to\\\\_id=\"huggingface/cool-model\")\\n```\\n## 管理存储库的本地副本\\n上述所有操作都可以通过HTTP请求完成。然而，在某些情况下，您可能希望在本地拥有存储库的副本，并使用您熟悉的Git命令与之交互。\\n[`Repository`] 类允许您使用类似于Git命令的函数与Hub上的文件和存储库进行交互。它是对Git和Git-LFS方法的包装，以使用您已经了解和喜爱的Git命令。在开始之前，请确保已安装Git-LFS（请参阅[此处](https://git-lfs.github.com/)获取安装说明）。\\n### 使用本地存储库\\n使用本地存储库路径实例化一个 [`Repository`] 对象：\\n请运行以下代码：\\n```py\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import Repository\\n>>> repo = Repository(local\\\\_dir=\"//\")\\n```\\n### 克隆\\n`clone\\\\_from`参数将一个存储库从Hugging Face存储库ID克隆到由 `local\\\\_dir`参数指定的本地目录：\\n请运行以下代码：\\n```py\\n>>> from huggingface\\\\_hub import Repository\\n>>> repo = Repository(local\\\\_dir=\"w2v2\", clone\\\\_from=\"facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60\")\\n```\\n`clone\\\\_from`还可以使用URL克隆存储库：\\n请运行以下代码：\\n```py\\n>>> repo = Repository(local\\\\_dir=\"huggingface-hub\", clone\\\\_from=\"https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60\")\\n```\\n你可以将`clone\\\\_from`参数与[`create\\\\_repo`]结合使用，以创建并克隆一个存储库：\\n请运行以下代码：\\n```py\\n>>> repo\\\\_url = create\\\\_repo(repo\\\\_id=\"repo\\\\_name\")\\n>>> repo = Repository(local\\\\_dir=\"repo\\\\_local\\\\_path\", clone\\\\_from=repo\\\\_url)\\n```\\n当你克隆一个存储库时，通过在克隆时指定`git\\\\_user`和`git\\\\_email`参数，你还可以为克隆的存储库配置Git用户名和电子邮件。当用户提交到该存储库时，Git将知道提交的作者是谁。\\n请运行以下代码：\\n```py\\n>>> repo = Repository(\\n...', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689aa83b3e684812d15f5bc0', 'page_content': \"There are three kinds of repositories on the Hub, and in this guide you'll be creating a \\\\*\\\\*model repository\\\\*\\\\* for demonstration purposes. For information on creating and managing models, datasets, and Spaces, refer to their respective documentation. 1. To create a new repository, visit [huggingface.co/new](http://huggingface.co/new):\\n\\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/new_repo.png)\\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/new_repo-dark.png)\\n\\n2. Specify the owner of the repository: this can be either you or any of the organizations you’re affiliated with. 3. Enter your model’s name. This will also be the name of the repository. 4. Specify whether you want your model to be public or private. 5. Specify the license. You can leave the \\\\*License\\\\* field blank for now. To learn about licenses, visit the [\\\\*\\\\*Licenses\\\\*\\\\*](repositories-licenses) documentation. After creating your model repository, you should see a page like this:\\n\\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/empty_repo.png)\\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/empty_repo-dark.png)\\n\\nNote that the Hub prompts you to create a \\\\*Model Card\\\\*, which you can learn about in the [\\\\*\\\\*Model Cards documentation\\\\*\\\\*](./model-cards). Including a Model Card in your model repo is best practice, but since we're only making a test repo at the moment we can skip this. ## Adding files to a repository (Web UI)\\nTo add files to your repository via the web UI, start by selecting the \\\\*\\\\*Files\\\\*\\\\* tab, navigating to the desired directory, and then clicking \\\\*\\\\*Add file\\\\*\\\\*. You'll be given the option to create a new file or upload a file directly from your computer. ![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/repositories-add_file.png)\\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/repositories-add_file-dark.png)\\n\\n### Creating a new file\\nChoosing to create a new file will take you to the following editor screen, where you can choose a name for your file, add content, and save your file with a message that summarizes your changes. Instead of directly committing the new file to your repo's `main` branch, you can select `Open as a pull request` to create a [Pull Request](./repositories-pull-requests-discussions). ![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/repositories-create_file.png)\\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/repositories-create_file-dark.png)\\n\\n### Uploading a file\\nIf you choose \\\\_Upload file\\\\_ you'll be able to choose a local file to upload, along with a message summarizing your changes to the repo. ![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/repositories-upload_file.png)\\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/repositories-upload_file-dark.png)\\n\\nAs with creating new files, you can select `Open as a pull request` to create a [Pull Request](./repositories-pull-requests-discussions) instead of adding your changes directly to the `main` branch of your repo. ## Adding files to a repository (terminal)[[terminal]]\\n### Cloning repositories\\nDownloading repositories to your local machine is called \\\\*cloning\\\\*. You can use the following commands to load your repo and navigate to it:\\n```bash\\ngit clone https://huggingface.co//\\ncd \\n```\\nYou can clone over SSH with the following command:\\n```bash\\ngit clone git@hf.co:/\\ncd \\n```\\nYou'll need to add your SSH public key to [your user settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/keys) to push changes or access private repositories. ### Set up\\nNow's the time, you can add any files you want to the repository! 🔥\\nDo you have files larger than 10MB? Those files should be tracked with `git-lfs`, which you can initialize with:\\n```bash\\ngit lfs install\\n```\\nNote that if your files are larger than \\\\*\\\\*5GB\\\\*\\\\* you'll also need to run:\\n```bash\\nhuggingface-cli lfs-enable-largefiles . ```\\nWhen you use Hugging Face to create a repository, Hugging Face automatically provides a list of common file extensions for common Machine Learning large files in the `.gitattributes` file, which `git-lfs` uses to efficiently track changes to your large files.\", 'type': 'Document'}}], 'status': 'success'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'messages', 'AIMessage'], 'kwargs': {'content': 'The default repository type created by the `create_repo` function on Hugging Face Hub is a model repository.', 'response_metadata': {'finish_reason': 'stop', 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_34a54ae93c'}, 'type': 'ai', 'id': 'run--735eb573-fa72-4eae-89b2-da545f3b14d3-0', 'usage_metadata': {'input_tokens': 4065, 'output_tokens': 22, 'total_tokens': 4087, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}, 'tool_calls': [], 'invalid_tool_calls': []}}], 'chat_history': []}\n"

If you\\'re interested in learning more about splits and configurations, check out the [Load a dataset from the Hub tutorial](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/main/en/load\\\\_hub)! This guide shows you how to use Datasets Server\\'s `/splits` endpoint to retrieve a dataset\\'s splits and configurations programmatically. Feel free to also try it out with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/huggingface/workspace/hugging-face-apis/request/23242779-f0cde3b9-c2ee-4062-aaca-65c4cfdd96f8), [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/hugging-face-hugging-face-default/api/hugging-face-datasets-api), or [ReDoc](https://redocly.github.io/redoc/?url=https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/openapi.json#operation/listSplits)\\nThe `/splits` endpoint accepts the dataset name as its query parameter:\\n\\n```python\\nimport requests\\nheaders = {\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {API\\\\_TOKEN}\"}\\nAPI\\\\_URL = \"https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/splits?dataset=duorc\"\\ndef query():\\nresponse = requests.get(API\\\\_URL, headers=headers)\\nreturn response.json()\\ndata = query()\\n```\\n\\n```js\\nimport fetch from \"node-fetch\";\\nasync function query(data) {\\nconst response = await fetch(\\n\"https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/splits?dataset=duorc\",\\n{\\nheaders: { Authorization: `Bearer ${API\\\\_TOKEN}` },\\nmethod: \"GET\"\\n}\\n);\\nconst result = await response.json();\\nreturn result;\\n}\\nquery().then((response) => {\\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(response));\\n});\\n```\\n\\n```curl\\ncurl https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/splits?dataset=duorc \\\\\\n-X GET \\\\\\n-H \"Authorization: Bearer ${API\\\\_TOKEN}\"\\n```\\nThe endpoint response is a JSON containing a list of the dataset\\'s splits and configurations.

Unlike [DistributedDataParallel (DDP)](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel.html), FSDP reduces memory-usage because a model is replicated on each GPU. This improves GPU memory-efficiency and allows you to train much larger models on fewer GPUs. FSDP is integrated with the Accelerate, a library for easily managing training in distributed environments, which means it is available for use from the [`Trainer`] class. Before you start, make sure Accelerate is installed and at least PyTorch 2.1.0 or newer. ```bash\\npip install accelerate\\n```\\n## FSDP configuration\\nTo start, run the [`accelerate config`](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/package\\\\_reference/cli#accelerate-config) command to create a configuration file for your training environment. Accelerate uses this configuration file to automatically setup the correct training environment based on your selected training options in `accelerate config`. ```bash\\naccelerate config\\n```\\nWhen you run `accelerate config`, you\\'ll be prompted with a series of options to configure your training environment.\\n\\n!--⚠️ Note that this file is in Markdown but contain specific syntax for our doc-builder (similar to MDX) that may not be\\nrendered properly in your Markdown viewer. -->\\n# Fully Sharded Data Parallel\\n[Fully sharded data parallel](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/fsdp.html) (FSDP) is developed for distributed training of large pretrained models up to 1T parameters. FSDP achieves this by sharding the model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states across data parallel processes and it can also offload sharded model parameters to a CPU. The memory efficiency afforded by FSDP allows you to scale training to larger batch or model sizes. Currently, FSDP does not confer any reduction in GPU memory usage and FSDP with CPU offload actually consumes 1.65x more GPU memory during training. You can track this PyTorch [issue](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/91165) for any updates. FSDP is supported in 🤗 Accelerate, and you can use it with 🤗 PEFT. This guide will help you learn how to use our FSDP [training script](https://github.com/huggingface/peft/blob/main/examples/conditional\\\\_generation/peft\\\\_lora\\\\_seq2seq\\\\_accelerate\\\\_fsdp.py). You\\'ll configure the script to train a large model for conditional generation. ## Configuration\\nBegin by running the following command to [create a FSDP configuration file](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/main/en/usage\\\\_guides/fsdp) with 🤗 Accelerate.

We will be leveraging Hugging Face Transformers, Accelerate and TRL. We will also learn how to use Accelerate with SLURM. Fully Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP) is a paradigm in which the optimizer states, gradients and parameters are sharded across devices. During the forward pass, each FSDP unit performs an \\\\_all-gather operation\\\\_ to get the complete weights, computation is performed followed by discarding the shards from other devices. After the forward pass, the loss is computed followed by the backward pass. In the backward pass, each FSDP unit performs an all-gather operation to get the complete weights, with computation performed to get the local gradients. These local gradients are averaged and sharded across the devices via a \\\\_reduce-scatter operation\\\\_ so that each device can update the parameters of its shard.

Unlike [DistributedDataParallel (DDP)](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel.html), FSDP reduces memory-usage because a model is replicated on each GPU. This improves GPU memory-efficiency and allows you to train much larger models on fewer GPUs. FSDP is integrated with the Accelerate, a library for easily managing training in distributed environments, which means it is available for use from the [`Trainer`] class. Before you start, make sure Accelerate is installed and at least PyTorch 2.1.0 or newer. ```bash\\npip install accelerate\\n```\\n## FSDP configuration\\nTo start, run the [`accelerate config`](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/package\\\\_reference/cli#accelerate-config) command to create a configuration file for your training environment. Accelerate uses this configuration file to automatically setup the correct training environment based on your selected training options in `accelerate config`. ```bash\\naccelerate config\\n```\\nWhen you run `accelerate config`, you\\'ll be prompted with a series of options to configure your training environment.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689aa96c3e684812d15f5cee', 'page_content': \"!--⚠️ Note that this file is in Markdown but contain specific syntax for our doc-builder (similar to MDX) that may not be\\nrendered properly in your Markdown viewer. -->\\n# Fully Sharded Data Parallel\\n[Fully sharded data parallel](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/fsdp.html) (FSDP) is developed for distributed training of large pretrained models up to 1T parameters. FSDP achieves this by sharding the model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states across data parallel processes and it can also offload sharded model parameters to a CPU. The memory efficiency afforded by FSDP allows you to scale training to larger batch or model sizes. Currently, FSDP does not confer any reduction in GPU memory usage and FSDP with CPU offload actually consumes 1.65x more GPU memory during training. You can track this PyTorch [issue](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/91165) for any updates. FSDP is supported in 🤗 Accelerate, and you can use it with 🤗 PEFT. This guide will help you learn how to use our FSDP [training script](https://github.com/huggingface/peft/blob/main/examples/conditional\\\\_generation/peft\\\\_lora\\\\_seq2seq\\\\_accelerate\\\\_fsdp.py). You'll configure the script to train a large model for conditional generation. ## Configuration\\nBegin by running the following command to [create a FSDP configuration file](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/main/en/usage\\\\_guides/fsdp) with 🤗 Accelerate. Use the `--config\\\\_file` flag to save the configuration file to a specific location, otherwise it is saved as a `default\\\\_config.yaml` file in the 🤗 Accelerate cache.

Taken from the [original paper.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08518) \\n## Usage: MarkupLMProcessor\\nThe easiest way to prepare data for the model is to use [`MarkupLMProcessor`], which internally combines a feature extractor\\n([`MarkupLMFeatureExtractor`]) and a tokenizer ([`MarkupLMTokenizer`] or [`MarkupLMTokenizerFast`]). The feature extractor is\\nused to extract all nodes and xpaths from the HTML strings, which are then provided to the tokenizer, which turns them into the\\ntoken-level inputs of the model (`input\\\\_ids` etc.). Note that you can still use the feature extractor and tokenizer separately,\\nif you only want to handle one of the two tasks. ```python\\nfrom transformers import MarkupLMFeatureExtractor, MarkupLMTokenizerFast, MarkupLMProcessor\\nfeature\\\\_extractor = MarkupLMFeatureExtractor()\\ntokenizer = MarkupLMTokenizerFast.from\\\\_pretrained(\"microsoft/markuplm-base\")\\nprocessor = MarkupLMProcessor(feature\\\\_extractor, tokenizer)\\n```\\nIn short, one can provide HTML strings (and possibly additional data) to [`MarkupLMProcessor`],\\nand it will create the inputs expected by the model. Internally, the processor first uses\\n[`MarkupLMFeatureExtractor`] to get a list of nodes and corresponding xpaths. The nodes and\\nxpaths are then provided to [`MarkupLMTokenizer`] or [`MarkupLMTokenizerFast`], which converts them\\nto token-level `input\\\\_ids`, `attention\\\\_mask`, `token\\\\_type\\\\_ids`, `xpath\\\\_subs\\\\_seq`, `xpath\\\\_tags\\\\_seq`. Optionally, one can provide node labels to the processor, which are turned into token-level `labels`. [`MarkupLMFeatureExtractor`] uses [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/), a Python library for\\npulling data out of HTML and XML files, under the hood. Note that you can still use your own parsing solution of\\nchoice, and provide the nodes and xpaths yourself to [`MarkupLMTokenizer`] or [`MarkupLMTokenizerFast`].\\n\\nIn total, there are 5 use cases that are supported by the processor. Below, we list them all. Note that each of these\\nuse cases work for both batched and non-batched inputs (we illustrate them for non-batched inputs). \\\\*\\\\*Use case 1: web page classification (training, inference) + token classification (inference), parse\\\\_html = True\\\\*\\\\*\\nThis is the simplest case, in which the processor will use the feature extractor to get all nodes and xpaths from the HTML. ```python\\n>>> from transformers import MarkupLMProcessor\\n>>> processor = MarkupLMProcessor.from\\\\_pretrained(\"microsoft/markuplm-base\")\\n>>> html\\\\_string = \"\"\"\\n... ... ... ... Hello world\\n... ... ... # Welcome\\n\\n...

In that case, one should\\nprovide the nodes and corresponding xpaths themselves to the processor, and make sure to set `parse\\\\_html` to `False`. ```python\\n>>> from transformers import MarkupLMProcessor\\n>>> processor = MarkupLMProcessor.from\\\\_pretrained(\"microsoft/markuplm-base\")\\n>>> processor.parse\\\\_html = False\\n>>> nodes = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"how\", \"are\"]\\n>>> xpaths = [\"/html/body/div/li[1]/div/span\", \"/html/body/div/li[1]/div/span\", \"html/body\", \"html/body/div\"]\\n>>> encoding = processor(nodes=nodes, xpaths=xpaths, return\\\\_tensors=\"pt\")\\n>>> print(encoding.keys())\\ndict\\\\_keys([\\'input\\\\_ids\\', \\'token\\\\_type\\\\_ids\\', \\'attention\\\\_mask\\', \\'xpath\\\\_tags\\\\_seq\\', \\'xpath\\\\_subs\\\\_seq\\'])\\n```\\n\\\\*\\\\*Use case 3: token classification (training), parse\\\\_html=False\\\\*\\\\*\\nFor token classification tasks (such as [SWDE](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/swde)), one can also provide the\\ncorresponding node labels in order to train a model.\\n\\n!--Copyright 2023 The HuggingFace Team.

Connection issues can always\\nhappen when streaming data and smaller files avoid resuming from the beginning in case of errors. - Files are served to the users using CloudFront. From our experience, huge files are not cached by this service\\nleading to a slower download speed. In all cases no single LFS file will be able to be >50GB. I.e. 50GB is the hard limit for single file size. - \\\\*\\\\*Number of commits\\\\*\\\\*: There is no hard limit for the total number of commits on your repo history. However, from\\nour experience, the user experience on the Hub starts to degrade after a few thousand commits.

It\\'s a\\nbidirectional transformer pretrained using a combination of masked language modeling objective and next sentence\\nprediction on a large corpus comprising the Toronto Book Corpus and Wikipedia. The abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations\\nfrom Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional\\nrepresentations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result,\\nthe pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models\\nfor a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific\\narchitecture modifications.\\\\*\\n\\\\*BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural\\nlanguage processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI\\naccuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute\\nimprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [thomwolf](https://huggingface.co/thomwolf).\\n\\n---\\n## 2. How does BERT Work? BERT works by leveraging the following:\\n### 2.1 Large amounts of training data\\nA massive dataset of 3.3 Billion words has contributed to BERT’s continued success. BERT was specifically trained on Wikipedia (\\\\~2.5B words) and Google’s BooksCorpus (\\\\~800M words). These large informational datasets contributed to BERT’s deep knowledge not only of the English language but also of our world! 🚀\\nTraining on a dataset this large takes a long time. BERT’s training was made possible thanks to the novel Transformer architecture and sped up by using TPUs (Tensor Processing Units - Google’s custom circuit built specifically for large ML models). —64 TPUs trained BERT over the course of 4 days. \\\\*\\\\*Note:\\\\*\\\\* Demand for smaller BERT models is increasing in order to use BERT within smaller computational environments (like cell phones and personal computers). [23 smaller BERT models were released in March 2020](https://github.com/google-research/bert). [DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model\\\\_doc/distilbert) offers a lighter version of BERT; runs 60% faster while maintaining over 95% of BERT’s performance. ### 2.2 What is a Masked Language Model?

The self-attention mechanism relates to different positions (or different words) in a single sequence, in order to compute a representation of that sequence.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689abb613e684812d15f71e1', 'page_content': '!--Copyright 2020 The HuggingFace Team.

It\\'s a\\nbidirectional transformer pretrained using a combination of masked language modeling objective and next sentence\\nprediction on a large corpus comprising the Toronto Book Corpus and Wikipedia. The abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations\\nfrom Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional\\nrepresentations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result,\\nthe pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models\\nfor a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific\\narchitecture modifications.\\\\*\\n\\\\*BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural\\nlanguage processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI\\naccuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute\\nimprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [thomwolf](https://huggingface.co/thomwolf).', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '6899bf77666af48523f51dc8', 'page_content': '---\\n## 2. How does BERT Work? BERT works by leveraging the following:\\n### 2.1 Large amounts of training data\\nA massive dataset of 3.3 Billion words has contributed to BERT’s continued success. BERT was specifically trained on Wikipedia (\\\\~2.5B words) and Google’s BooksCorpus (\\\\~800M words). These large informational datasets contributed to BERT’s deep knowledge not only of the English language but also of our world! 🚀\\nTraining on a dataset this large takes a long time. BERT’s training was made possible thanks to the novel Transformer architecture and sped up by using TPUs (Tensor Processing Units - Google’s custom circuit built specifically for large ML models). —64 TPUs trained BERT over the course of 4 days. \\\\*\\\\*Note:\\\\*\\\\* Demand for smaller BERT models is increasing in order to use BERT within smaller computational environments (like cell phones and personal computers). [23 smaller BERT models were released in March 2020](https://github.com/google-research/bert). [DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model\\\\_doc/distilbert) offers a lighter version of BERT; runs 60% faster while maintaining over 95% of BERT’s performance. ### 2.2 What is a Masked Language Model?

It has since been reused in quite a few Transformer models based on BERT, such as DistilBERT, MobileBERT, Funnel Transformers, and MPNET. It\\'s very similar to BPE in terms of the training, but the actual tokenization is done differently. 💡 This section covers WordPiece in depth, going as far as showing a full implementation. You can skip to the end if you just want a general overview of the tokenization algorithm. ## Training algorithm[[training-algorithm]]\\n⚠️ Google never open-sourced its implementation of the training algorithm of WordPiece, so what follows is our best guess based on the published literature. It may not be 100% accurate. Like BPE, WordPiece starts from a small vocabulary including the special tokens used by the model and the initial alphabet. Since it identifies subwords by adding a prefix (like `##` for BERT), each word is initially split by adding that prefix to all the characters inside the word. So, for instance, `\"word\"` gets split like this:\\n```\\nw ##o ##r ##d\\n```\\nThus, the initial alphabet contains all the characters present at the beginning of a word and the characters present inside a word preceded by the WordPiece prefix. Then, again like BPE, WordPiece learns merge rules. The main difference is the way the pair to be merged is selected. Instead of selecting the most frequent pair, WordPiece computes a score for each pair, using the following formula:\\n$$\\\\mathrm{score} = (\\\\mathrm{freq\\\\\\\\_of\\\\\\\\_pair}) / (\\\\mathrm{freq\\\\\\\\_of\\\\\\\\_first\\\\\\\\_element} \\\\times \\\\mathrm{freq\\\\\\\\_of\\\\\\\\_second\\\\\\\\_element})$$\\nBy dividing the frequency of the pair by the product of the frequencies of each of its parts, the algorithm prioritizes the merging of pairs where the individual parts are less frequent in the vocabulary.\\n\\nFor instance,\\nthe word `\"bug\"` would be tokenized to `[\"b\", \"ug\"]` but `\"mug\"` would be tokenized as `[\"\", \"ug\"]` since\\nthe symbol `\"m\"` is not in the base vocabulary. In general, single letters such as `\"m\"` are not replaced by the\\n`\"\"` symbol because the training data usually includes at least one occurrence of each letter, but it is likely\\nto happen for very special characters like emojis. As mentioned earlier, the vocabulary size, \\\\*i.e.\\\\* the base vocabulary size + the number of merges, is a hyperparameter\\nto choose. For instance [GPT](model\\\\_doc/gpt) has a vocabulary size of 40,478 since they have 478 base characters\\nand chose to stop training after 40,000 merges. #### Byte-level BPE\\nA base vocabulary that includes all possible base characters can be quite large if \\\\*e.g.\\\\* all unicode characters are\\nconsidered as base characters. To have a better base vocabulary, [GPT-2](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language\\\\_models\\\\_are\\\\_unsupervised\\\\_multitask\\\\_learners.pdf) uses bytes\\nas the base vocabulary, which is a clever trick to force the base vocabulary to be of size 256 while ensuring that\\nevery base character is included in the vocabulary. With some additional rules to deal with punctuation, the GPT2\\'s\\ntokenizer can tokenize every text without the need for the  symbol. [GPT-2](model\\\\_doc/gpt) has a vocabulary\\nsize of 50,257, which corresponds to the 256 bytes base tokens, a special end-of-text token and the symbols learned\\nwith 50,000 merges. ### WordPiece\\nWordPiece is the subword tokenization algorithm used for [BERT](model\\\\_doc/bert), [DistilBERT](model\\\\_doc/distilbert), and [Electra](model\\\\_doc/electra). The algorithm was outlined in [Japanese and Korean\\nVoice Search (Schuster et al., 2012)](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/ja//pubs/archive/37842.pdf) and is very similar to\\nBPE. WordPiece first initializes the vocabulary to include every character present in the training data and\\nprogressively learns a given number of merge rules. In contrast to BPE, WordPiece does not choose the most frequent\\nsymbol pair, but the one that maximizes the likelihood of the training data once added to the vocabulary. So what does this mean exactly? Referring to the previous example, maximizing the likelihood of the training data is\\nequivalent to finding the symbol pair, whose probability divided by the probabilities of its first symbol followed by\\nits second symbol is the greatest among all symbol pairs. \\\\*E.g.\\\\* `\"u\"`, followed by `\"g\"` would have only been\\nmerged if the probability of `\"ug\"` divided by `\"u\"`, `\"g\"` would have been greater than for any other symbol\\npair. Intuitively, WordPiece is slightly different to BPE in that it evaluates what it \\\\_loses\\\\_ by merging two symbols\\nto ensure it\\'s \\\\_worth it\\\\_. ### Unigram\\nUnigram is a subword tokenization algorithm introduced in [Subword Regularization: Improving Neural Network Translation\\nModels with Multiple Subword Candidates (Kudo, 2018)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.10959.pdf). In contrast to BPE or\\nWordPiece, Unigram initializes its base vocabulary to a large number of symbols and progressively trims down each\\nsymbol to obtain a smaller vocabulary. The base vocabulary could for instance correspond to all pre-tokenized words and\\nthe most common substrings. Unigram is not used directly for any of the models in the transformers, but it\\'s used in\\nconjunction with [SentencePiece](#sentencepiece). At each training step, the Unigram algorithm defines a loss (often defined as the log-likelihood) over the training\\ndata given the current vocabulary and a unigram language model. Then, for each symbol in the vocabulary, the algorithm\\ncomputes how much the overall loss would increase if the symbol was to be removed from the vocabulary. Unigram then\\nremoves p (with p usually being 10% or 20%) percent of the symbols whose loss increase is the lowest, \\\\*i.e.\\\\* those\\nsymbols that least affect the overall loss over the training data. This process is repeated until the vocabulary has\\nreached the desired size. The Unigram algorithm always keeps the base characters so that any word can be tokenized. Because Unigram is not based on merge rules (in contrast to BPE and WordPiece), the algorithm has several ways of\\ntokenizing new text after training. As an example, if a trained Unigram tokenizer exhibits the vocabulary:\\n```\\n[\"b\", \"g\", \"h\", \"n\", \"p\", \"s\", \"u\", \"ug\", \"un\", \"hug\"],\\n```\\n`\"hugs\"` could be tokenized both as `[\"hug\", \"s\"]`, `[\"h\", \"ug\", \"s\"]` or `[\"h\", \"u\", \"g\", \"s\"]`. So which one\\nto choose? Unigram saves the probability of each token in the training corpus on top of saving the vocabulary so that\\nthe probability of each possible tokenization can be computed after training.\\n\\net\\'s see together what is the training strategy of the WordPiece algorithm and how it performs the tokenization of a text once trained WordPiece is a tokenization algorithm introduced by Google. It is used for example by Bert. To our knowledge, the code of Word Pieces has not been open sourced, so we base our explanations on our own interpretation of the published literature. What is the training strategy of WordPiece? Similarly to the BPE algorithm, WordPiece starts by establishing an initial vocabulary composed of elementary units and then increases this vocabulary to the desired size. To build the initial vocabulary, we divide each word in the training corpus into the sequence of letters that make it up. As you can see, there is a small subtlety: we add a 2 hashtags in front of the letters that do not start a word. By keeping only one occurrence per elementary unit we now have our initial vocabulary. We will list all the existing pairs in our corpus. Once we have this list, we will calculate a score for each of these pairs. As for the BPE algorithm, we will select the pair with the highest score. Taking for example the first pair composed of H and U. The score of a pair is simply equal to the frequency of appearance of the pair divided by the product of the frequency of appearance of the first token by the frequency of appearance of the second token. Thus at a fixed frequency of appearance of the pair, if the subparts of the pair are very frequent in the corpus then this score will be decreased. In our example, the pair \"hu\" appears 4 times, the letter \"h\" 4 times and the letter u 4 times.', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': '5ea58dbf-9541-4fdb-898a-d8afad419b00', 'tool_call_id': 'call_OQyb60EGWV33HC12FZdjFVYD', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689aaf263e684812d15f63e9', 'page_content': 'WordPiece tokenization[[wordpiece-tokenization]]\\nWordPiece is the tokenization algorithm Google developed to pretrain BERT.

In the next lesson, you\\'ll learn how to train your own diffusion model to generate what you want. After completing the tutorials, you\\'ll have gained the necessary skills to start exploring the library on your own and see how to use it for your own projects and applications.

Capturing these \"hard\" data points is valuable because it allows you to improve your machine learning model and make it more reliable and robust. Gradio simplifies the collection of this data by including a \\\\*\\\\*Flag\\\\*\\\\* button with every `Interface`. This allows a user or tester to easily send data back to the machine where the demo is running. In this Guide, we discuss more about how to use the flagging feature, both with `gradio.Interface` as well as with `gradio.Blocks`. ## The \\\\*\\\\*Flag\\\\*\\\\* button in `gradio.Interface`\\nFlagging with Gradio\\'s `Interface` is especially easy. By default, underneath the output components, there is a button marked \\\\*\\\\*Flag\\\\*\\\\*. When a user testing your model sees input with interesting output, they can click the flag button to send the input and output data back to the machine where the demo is running. The sample is saved to a CSV log file (by default). If the demo involves images, audio, video, or other types of files, these are saved separately in a parallel directory and the paths to these files are saved in the CSV file. There are [four parameters](https://gradio.app/docs/#interface-header) in `gradio.Interface` that control how flagging works. We will go over them in greater detail. - `allow\\\\_flagging`: this parameter can be set to either `\"manual\"` (default), `\"auto\"`, or `\"never\"`. - `manual`: users will see a button to flag, and samples are only flagged when the button is clicked. - `auto`: users will not see a button to flag, but every sample will be flagged automatically. - `never`: users will not see a button to flag, and no sample will be flagged. - `flagging\\\\_options`: this parameter can be either `None` (default) or a list of strings. - If `None`, then the user simply clicks on the \\\\*\\\\*Flag\\\\*\\\\* button and no additional options are shown. - If a list of strings are provided, then the user sees several buttons, corresponding to each of the strings that are provided. For example, if the value of this parameter is `[\"Incorrect\", \"Ambiguous\"]`, then buttons labeled \\\\*\\\\*Flag as Incorrect\\\\*\\\\* and \\\\*\\\\*Flag as Ambiguous\\\\*\\\\* appear. This only applies if `allow\\\\_flagging` is `\"manual\"`. - The chosen option is then logged along with the input and output. - `flagging\\\\_dir`: this parameter takes a string. - It represents what to name the directory where flagged data is stored. - `flagging\\\\_callback`: this parameter takes an instance of a subclass of the `FlaggingCallback` class\\n- Using this parameter allows you to write custom code that gets run when the flag button is clicked\\n- By default, this is set to an instance of `gr.CSVLogger`\\n- One example is setting it to an instance of `gr.HuggingFaceDatasetSaver` which can allow you to pipe any flagged data into a HuggingFace Dataset.\\n\\n(See more below.)\\n## What happens to flagged data? Within the directory provided by the `flagging\\\\_dir` argument, a CSV file will log the flagged data. Here\\'s an example: The code below creates the calculator interface embedded below it:\\n```python\\nimport gradio as gr\\ndef calculator(num1, operation, num2):\\nif operation == \"add\":\\nreturn num1 + num2\\nelif operation == \"subtract\":\\nreturn num1 - num2\\nelif operation == \"multiply\":\\nreturn num1 \\\\* num2\\nelif operation == \"divide\":\\nreturn num1 / num2\\niface = gr.Interface(\\ncalculator,\\n[\"number\", gr.Radio([\"add\", \"subtract\", \"multiply\", \"divide\"]), \"number\"],\\n\"number\",\\nallow\\\\_flagging=\"manual\"\\n)\\niface.launch()\\n```\\nWhen you click the flag button above, the directory where the interface was launched will include a new flagged subfolder, with a csv file inside it. This csv file includes all the data that was flagged. ```directory\\n+-- flagged/\\n| +-- logs.csv\\n```\\n\\\\_flagged/logs.csv\\\\_\\n```csv\\nnum1,operation,num2,Output,timestamp\\n5,add,7,12,2022-01-31 11:40:51.093412\\n6,subtract,1.5,4.5,2022-01-31 03:25:32.023542\\n```\\nIf the interface involves file data, such as for Image and Audio components, folders will be created to store those flagged data as well. For example an `image` input to `image` output interface will create the following structure. ```directory\\n+-- flagged/\\n| +-- logs.csv\\n| +-- image/\\n| | +-- 0.png\\n| | +-- 1.png\\n| +-- Output/\\n| | +-- 0.png\\n| | +-- 1.png\\n```\\n\\\\_flagged/logs.csv\\\\_\\n```csv\\nim,Output timestamp\\nim/0.png,Output/0.png,2022-02-04 19:49:58.026963\\nim/1.png,Output/1.png,2022-02-02 10:40:51.093412\\n```\\nIf you wish for the user to provide a reason for flagging, you can pass a list of strings to the `flagging\\\\_options` argument of Interface. Users will have to select one of these choices when flagging, and the option will be saved as an additional column to the CSV. If we go back to the calculator example, the following code will create the interface embedded below it. ```python\\niface = gr.Interface(\\ncalculator,\\n[\"number\", gr.Radio([\"add\", \"subtract\", \"multiply\", \"divide\"]), \"number\"],\\n\"number\",\\nallow\\\\_flagging=\"manual\",\\nflagging\\\\_options=[\"wrong sign\", \"off by one\", \"other\"]\\n)\\niface.launch()\\n```\\nWhen users click the flag button, the csv file will now include a column indicating the selected option. \\\\_flagged/logs.csv\\\\_\\n```csv\\nnum1,operation,num2,Output,flag,timestamp\\n5,add,7,-12,wrong sign,2022-02-04 11:40:51.093412\\n6,subtract,1.5,3.5,off by one,2022-02-04 11:42:32.062512\\n```\\n## The HuggingFaceDatasetSaver Callback\\nSometimes, saving the data to a local CSV file doesn\\'t make sense.\\n\\n使用标记\\n相关空间：https://huggingface.co/spaces/gradio/calculator-flagging-crowdsourced, https://huggingface.co/spaces/gradio/calculator-flagging-options, https://huggingface.co/spaces/gradio/calculator-flag-basic\\n标签：标记，数据\\n## 简介\\n当您演示一个机器学习模型时，您可能希望收集试用模型的用户的数据，特别是模型行为不如预期的数据点。捕获这些“困难”数据点是有价值的，因为它允许您改进机器学习模型并使其更可靠和稳健。\\nGradio 通过在每个“界面”中包含一个\\\\*\\\\*标记\\\\*\\\\*按钮来简化这些数据的收集。这使得用户或测试人员可以轻松地将数据发送回运行演示的机器。样本会保存在一个 CSV 日志文件中（默认情况下）。如果演示涉及图像、音频、视频或其他类型的文件，则这些文件会单独保存在一个并行目录中，并且这些文件的路径会保存在 CSV 文件中。\\n## 在 `gradio.Interface` 中使用\\\\*\\\\*标记\\\\*\\\\*按钮\\n使用 Gradio 的 `Interface` 进行标记特别简单。默认情况下，在输出组件下方有一个标记为\\\\*\\\\*标记\\\\*\\\\*的按钮。当用户测试您的模型时，如果看到有趣的输出，他们可以点击标记按钮将输入和输出数据发送回运行演示的机器。样本会保存在一个 CSV 日志文件中（默认情况下）。如果演示涉及图像、音频、视频或其他类型的文件，则这些文件会单独保存在一个并行目录中，并且这些文件的路径会保存在 CSV 文件中。\\n在 `gradio.Interface` 中有[四个参数](https://gradio.app/docs/#interface-header)控制标记的工作方式。我们将详细介绍它们。\\n- `allow\\\\_flagging`：此参数可以设置为 `\"manual\"`（默认值），`\"auto\"` 或 `\"never\"`。\\n- `manual`：用户将看到一个标记按钮，只有在点击按钮时样本才会被标记。\\n- `auto`：用户将不会看到一个标记按钮，但每个样本都会自动被标记。\\n- `never`：用户将不会看到一个标记按钮，并且不会标记任何样本。\\n- `flagging\\\\_options`：此参数可以是 `None`（默认值）或字符串列表。\\n- 如果是 `None`，则用户只需点击\\\\*\\\\*标记\\\\*\\\\*按钮，不会显示其他选项。\\n- 如果提供了一个字符串列表，则用户会看到多个按钮，对应于提供的每个字符串。例如，如果此参数的值为`[\" 错误 \", \" 模糊 \"]`，则会显示标记为\\\\*\\\\*标记为错误\\\\*\\\\*和\\\\*\\\\*标记为模糊\\\\*\\\\*的按钮。这仅适用于 `allow\\\\_flagging` 为 `\"manual\"` 的情况。\\n- 所选选项将与输入和输出一起记录。\\n- `flagging\\\\_dir`：此参数接受一个字符串。\\n- 它表示标记数据存储的目录名称。\\n- `flagging\\\\_callback`：此参数接受 `FlaggingCallback` 类的子类的实例\\n- 使用此参数允许您编写在点击标记按钮时运行的自定义代码\\n- 默认情况下，它设置为 `gr.CSVLogger` 的一个实例\\n- 一个示例是将其设置为 `gr.HuggingFaceDatasetSaver` 的一个实例，这样您可以将任何标记的数据导入到 HuggingFace 数据集中（参见下文）。\\n## 标记的数据会发生什么？\\n在 `flagging\\\\_dir` 参数提供的目录中，将记录标记的数据的 CSV 文件。\\n以下是一个示例：下面的代码创建了嵌入其中的计算器界面：\\n```python\\nimport gradio as gr\\ndef calculator(num1, operation, num2):\\nif operation == \"add\":\\nreturn num1 + num2\\nelif operation == \"subtract\":\\nreturn num1 -

Capturing these \"hard\" data points is valuable because it allows you to improve your machine learning model and make it more reliable and robust. Gradio simplifies the collection of this data by including a \\\\*\\\\*Flag\\\\*\\\\* button with every `Interface`. This allows a user or tester to easily send data back to the machine where the demo is running. In this Guide, we discuss more about how to use the flagging feature, both with `gradio.Interface` as well as with `gradio.Blocks`. ## The \\\\*\\\\*Flag\\\\*\\\\* button in `gradio.Interface`\\nFlagging with Gradio\\'s `Interface` is especially easy. By default, underneath the output components, there is a button marked \\\\*\\\\*Flag\\\\*\\\\*. When a user testing your model sees input with interesting output, they can click the flag button to send the input and output data back to the machine where the demo is running. The sample is saved to a CSV log file (by default). If the demo involves images, audio, video, or other types of files, these are saved separately in a parallel directory and the paths to these files are saved in the CSV file. There are [four parameters](https://gradio.app/docs/#interface-header) in `gradio.Interface` that control how flagging works. We will go over them in greater detail. - `allow\\\\_flagging`: this parameter can be set to either `\"manual\"` (default), `\"auto\"`, or `\"never\"`. - `manual`: users will see a button to flag, and samples are only flagged when the button is clicked. - `auto`: users will not see a button to flag, but every sample will be flagged automatically. - `never`: users will not see a button to flag, and no sample will be flagged. - `flagging\\\\_options`: this parameter can be either `None` (default) or a list of strings. - If `None`, then the user simply clicks on the \\\\*\\\\*Flag\\\\*\\\\* button and no additional options are shown. - If a list of strings are provided, then the user sees several buttons, corresponding to each of the strings that are provided. For example, if the value of this parameter is `[\"Incorrect\", \"Ambiguous\"]`, then buttons labeled \\\\*\\\\*Flag as Incorrect\\\\*\\\\* and \\\\*\\\\*Flag as Ambiguous\\\\*\\\\* appear. This only applies if `allow\\\\_flagging` is `\"manual\"`. - The chosen option is then logged along with the input and output. - `flagging\\\\_dir`: this parameter takes a string. - It represents what to name the directory where flagged data is stored. - `flagging\\\\_callback`: this parameter takes an instance of a subclass of the `FlaggingCallback` class\\n- Using this parameter allows you to write custom code that gets run when the flag button is clicked\\n- By default, this is set to an instance of `gr.CSVLogger`\\n- One example is setting it to an instance of `gr.HuggingFaceDatasetSaver` which can allow you to pipe any flagged data into a HuggingFace Dataset.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '6899c32e666af48523f52268', 'page_content': '(See more below.)\\n## What happens to flagged data? Within the directory provided by the `flagging\\\\_dir` argument, a CSV file will log the flagged data. Here\\'s an example: The code below creates the calculator interface embedded below it:\\n```python\\nimport gradio as gr\\ndef calculator(num1, operation, num2):\\nif operation == \"add\":\\nreturn num1 + num2\\nelif operation == \"subtract\":\\nreturn num1 - num2\\nelif operation == \"multiply\":\\nreturn num1 \\\\* num2\\nelif operation == \"divide\":\\nreturn num1 / num2\\niface = gr.Interface(\\ncalculator,\\n[\"number\", gr.Radio([\"add\", \"subtract\", \"multiply\", \"divide\"]), \"number\"],\\n\"number\",\\nallow\\\\_flagging=\"manual\"\\n)\\niface.launch()\\n```\\nWhen you click the flag button above, the directory where the interface was launched will include a new flagged subfolder, with a csv file inside it. This csv file includes all the data that was flagged. ```directory\\n+-- flagged/\\n| +-- logs.csv\\n```\\n\\\\_flagged/logs.csv\\\\_\\n```csv\\nnum1,operation,num2,Output,timestamp\\n5,add,7,12,2022-01-31 11:40:51.093412\\n6,subtract,1.5,4.5,2022-01-31 03:25:32.023542\\n```\\nIf the interface involves file data, such as for Image and Audio components, folders will be created to store those flagged data as well. For example an `image` input to `image` output interface will create the following structure. ```directory\\n+-- flagged/\\n| +-- logs.csv\\n| +-- image/\\n| | +-- 0.png\\n| | +-- 1.png\\n| +-- Output/\\n| | +-- 0.png\\n| | +-- 1.png\\n```\\n\\\\_flagged/logs.csv\\\\_\\n```csv\\nim,Output timestamp\\nim/0.png,Output/0.png,2022-02-04 19:49:58.026963\\nim/1.png,Output/1.png,2022-02-02 10:40:51.093412\\n```\\nIf you wish for the user to provide a reason for flagging, you can pass a list of strings to the `flagging\\\\_options` argument of Interface. Users will have to select one of these choices when flagging, and the option will be saved as an additional column to the CSV. If we go back to the calculator example, the following code will create the interface embedded below it. ```python\\niface = gr.Interface(\\ncalculator,\\n[\"number\", gr.Radio([\"add\", \"subtract\", \"multiply\", \"divide\"]), \"number\"],\\n\"number\",\\nallow\\\\_flagging=\"manual\",\\nflagging\\\\_options=[\"wrong sign\", \"off by one\", \"other\"]\\n)\\niface.launch()\\n```\\nWhen users click the flag button, the csv file will now include a column indicating the selected option. \\\\_flagged/logs.csv\\\\_\\n```csv\\nnum1,operation,num2,Output,flag,timestamp\\n5,add,7,-12,wrong sign,2022-02-04 11:40:51.093412\\n6,subtract,1.5,3.5,off by one,2022-02-04 11:42:32.062512\\n```\\n## The HuggingFaceDatasetSaver Callback\\nSometimes, saving the data to a local CSV file doesn\\'t make sense.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689aa99f3e684812d15f5d2f', 'page_content': '使用标记\\n相关空间：https://huggingface.co/spaces/gradio/calculator-flagging-crowdsourced, https://huggingface.co/spaces/gradio/calculator-flagging-options, https://huggingface.co/spaces/gradio/calculator-flag-basic\\n标签：标记，数据\\n## 简介\\n当您演示一个机器学习模型时，您可能希望收集试用模型的用户的数据，特别是模型行为不如预期的数据点。捕获这些“困难”数据点是有价值的，因为它允许您改进机器学习模型并使其更可靠和稳健。\\nGradio 通过在每个“界面”中包含一个\\\\*\\\\*标记\\\\*\\\\*按钮来简化这些数据的收集。这使得用户或测试人员可以轻松地将数据发送回运行演示的机器。样本会保存在一个 CSV 日志文件中（默认情况下）。如果演示涉及图像、音频、视频或其他类型的文件，则这些文件会单独保存在一个并行目录中，并且这些文件的路径会保存在 CSV 文件中。\\n## 在 `gradio.Interface` 中使用\\\\*\\\\*标记\\\\*\\\\*按钮\\n使用 Gradio 的 `Interface` 进行标记特别简单。默认情况下，在输出组件下方有一个标记为\\\\*\\\\*标记\\\\*\\\\*的按钮。当用户测试您的模型时，如果看到有趣的输出，他们可以点击标记按钮将输入和输出数据发送回运行演示的机器。样本会保存在一个 CSV 日志文件中（默认情况下）。如果演示涉及图像、音频、视频或其他类型的文件，则这些文件会单独保存在一个并行目录中，并且这些文件的路径会保存在 CSV 文件中。\\n在 `gradio.Interface` 中有[四个参数](https://gradio.app/docs/#interface-header)控制标记的工作方式。我们将详细介绍它们。\\n- `allow\\\\_flagging`：此参数可以设置为 `\"manual\"`（默认值），`\"auto\"` 或 `\"never\"`。\\n- `manual`：用户将看到一个标记按钮，只有在点击按钮时样本才会被标记。\\n- `auto`：用户将不会看到一个标记按钮，但每个样本都会自动被标记。\\n- `never`：用户将不会看到一个标记按钮，并且不会标记任何样本。\\n- `flagging\\\\_options`：此参数可以是 `None`（默认值）或字符串列表。\\n- 如果是 `None`，则用户只需点击\\\\*\\\\*标记\\\\*\\\\*按钮，不会显示其他选项。\\n- 如果提供了一个字符串列表，则用户会看到多个按钮，对应于提供的每个字符串。例如，如果此参数的值为`[\" 错误 \", \" 模糊 \"]`，则会显示标记为\\\\*\\\\*标记为错误\\\\*\\\\*和\\\\*\\\\*标记为模糊\\\\*\\\\*的按钮。这仅适用于 `allow\\\\_flagging` 为 `\"manual\"` 的情况。\\n- 所选选项将与输入和输出一起记录。\\n- `flagging\\\\_dir`：此参数接受一个字符串。\\n- 它表示标记数据存储的目录名称。\\n- `flagging\\\\_callback`：此参数接受 `FlaggingCallback` 类的子类的实例\\n- 使用此参数允许您编写在点击标记按钮时运行的自定义代码\\n- 默认情况下，它设置为 `gr.CSVLogger` 的一个实例\\n- 一个示例是将其设置为 `gr.HuggingFaceDatasetSaver` 的一个实例，这样您可以将任何标记的数据导入到 HuggingFace 数据集中（参见下文）。\\n## 标记的数据会发生什么？\\n在 `flagging\\\\_dir` 参数提供的目录中，将记录标记的数据的 CSV 文件。\\n以下是一个示例：下面的代码创建了嵌入其中的计算器界面：\\n```python\\nimport gradio as gr\\ndef calculator(num1, operation, num2):\\nif operation == \"add\":\\nreturn num1 + num2\\nelif operation == \"subtract\":\\nreturn num1 -

It\\'s a\\nbidirectional transformer pretrained using a combination of masked language modeling objective and next sentence\\nprediction on a large corpus comprising the Toronto Book Corpus and Wikipedia. The abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations\\nfrom Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional\\nrepresentations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result,\\nthe pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models\\nfor a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific\\narchitecture modifications.\\\\*\\n\\\\*BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural\\nlanguage processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI\\naccuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute\\nimprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [thomwolf](https://huggingface.co/thomwolf).', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': 'fe3f1fe5-9c2e-4f6c-8cf4-f65840868522', 'tool_call_id': 'call_ExwWfUA7YS8zcPsLRHicr69G', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '6899c123666af48523f51fc0', 'page_content': '!--Copyright 2021 The HuggingFace Team.

Hence, it is highly recommended to use the same maximum\\nsequence length for fine-tuning and inference. ## Resources\\n- [Text classification task guide](../tasks/sequence\\\\_classification)\\n- [Token classification task guide](../tasks/token\\\\_classification)\\n- [Question answering task guide](../tasks/question\\\\_answering)\\n- [Masked language modeling task guide](../tasks/masked\\\\_language\\\\_modeling)\\n- [Multiple choice task guide](../tasks/multiple\\\\_choice)\\n## FNetConfig\\n[[autodoc]] FNetConfig\\n## FNetTokenizer\\n[[autodoc]] FNetTokenizer\\n- build\\\\_inputs\\\\_with\\\\_special\\\\_tokens\\n- get\\\\_special\\\\_tokens\\\\_mask\\n- create\\\\_token\\\\_type\\\\_ids\\\\_from\\\\_sequences\\n- save\\\\_vocabulary\\n## FNetTokenizerFast\\n[[autodoc]] FNetTokenizerFast\\n## FNetModel\\n[[autodoc]] FNetModel\\n- forward\\n## FNetForPreTraining\\n[[autodoc]] FNetForPreTraining\\n- forward\\n## FNetForMaskedLM\\n[[autodoc]] FNetForMaskedLM\\n- forward\\n## FNetForNextSentencePrediction\\n[[autodoc]] FNetForNextSentencePrediction\\n- forward\\n## FNetForSequenceClassification\\n[[autodoc]] FNetForSequenceClassification\\n- forward\\n## FNetForMultipleChoice\\n[[autodoc]] FNetForMultipleChoice\\n- forward\\n## FNetForTokenClassification\\n[[autodoc]] FNetForTokenClassification\\n- forward\\n## FNetForQuestionAnswering\\n[[autodoc]] FNetForQuestionAnswering\\n- forward', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689ab5453e684812d15f6b0d', 'page_content': '!--Copyright 2020 The HuggingFace Team.

It\\'s a\\nbidirectional transformer pretrained using a combination of masked language modeling objective and next sentence\\nprediction on a large corpus comprising the Toronto Book Corpus and Wikipedia. The abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations\\nfrom Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional\\nrepresentations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result,\\nthe pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models\\nfor a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific\\narchitecture modifications.\\\\*\\n\\\\*BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural\\nlanguage processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI\\naccuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute\\nimprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [thomwolf](https://huggingface.co/thomwolf).', 'type': 'Document'}}], 'status': 'success'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'messages', 'AIMessage'], 'kwargs': {'content': 'The FNet model replaces the self-attention layer in a BERT model with a Fourier transform, which returns only the real parts of the transform.', 'response_metadata': {'finish_reason': 'stop', 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_34a54ae93c'}, 'type': 'ai', 'id': 'run--e015ffda-dd73-4edf-9155-f8c24a19e0b0-0', 'usage_metadata': {'input_tokens': 2306, 'output_tokens': 30, 'total_tokens': 2336, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}, 'tool_calls': [], 'invalid_tool_calls': []}}], 'chat_history': []}\n"

Ensure that the Gradio library functions as we expect it to. 2. Enable the maintenance team to quickly identify both the presence and source of defects. 3. Prevent regressions, i.e. if we fix something it should stay fixed. 4. Improve the quality of the codebase in order to ease maintenance efforts. 5. Reduce the amount of manual testing required. ## Scope\\nTesting is always a tradeoff. We can't cover everything unless we want to spend all of our time writing and running tests. We should focus on a few keys areas. We should not focus on code coverage but on test coverage following the below criteria:\\n- The documented Gradio API (that's the bit that users interact with via python) should be tested thoroughly. (1)\\n- Additional gradio elements that are both publicly available and used internally (such as the Python and JS client libraries) should be tested thoroughly.

The importance of each individual component, and the appropriate investment of effort, needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. (1)\\n- Element boundaries should be tested where there is reasonable cause to do so (e.g. config generation) (1)\\n- Implementation details should only be tested where there is sufficient complexity to warrant it. (1)\\n- Bug fixes should be accompanied by tests wherever is reasonably possible. (3)\\n## Types of testing\\nOur tests will broadly fall into one of three categories:\\n- Static Quality checks\\n- Dynamic 'Code' tests\\n- Dynamic Functional tests\\n### Static Quality checks\\nStatic quality checks are generally very fast to run and do not require building the code base.\\n\\nTests in this category could be browser-based end-to-end tests, accessibility tests, or performance tests. They are sometimes called acceptance tests. ## Testing tools\\nWe currently use the following tools:\\n### Static quality checks\\n- Python type-checking (python)\\n- Black linting (python)\\n- ruff formatting (python)\\n- prettier formatting (javascript/svelte)\\n- TypeScript type-checking (javascript/svelte)\\n- eslint linting (javascript/svelte) [in progress]\\n### Dynamic code tests\\n- pytest (python unit and integration tests)\\n- vitest (node-based unit and integration tests)\\n- playwright (browser-based unit and integration tests)\\n### Functional/acceptance tests\\n- playwright (full end to end testing)\\n- chromatic (visual testing) [in progress]\\n- Accessibility testing [to do]\\n## Supported environments and versions\\nAll operating systems refer to the current runner variants supported by GitHub actions.

For instructions on how to write and run tests see the [contributing guide](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). ## Managing defects\\nAs we formalise our testing strategy and bring / keep our test up to standard, it is important that we have some principles on managing defects as they occur/ are reported. For now we can have one very simple rule:\\n- Every bug fix should be accompanied by a test that failed before the fix and passes afterwards.

The promise of 🤗 Accelerate is:\\n- to keep the changes to your training loop to the bare minimum so you have to learn as little as possible. - to have the same functions work for any distributed setup, so only have to learn one API. ### How does it work? To see how the library works in practice, let\\'s have a look at each line of code we need to add to a training loop. ```python\\naccelerator = Accelerator()\\n```\\nOn top of giving the main object that you will use, this line will analyze from the environment the type of distributed training run and perform the necessary initialization. You can force a training on CPU or a mixed precision training by passing `cpu=True` or `fp16=True` to this init.

In this section, we\\'ll explore exactly what happens in the tokenization pipeline. In NLP tasks, the data that is generally processed is raw text. Here\\'s an example of such text:\\n```\\nJim Henson was a puppeteer\\n```\\nHowever, models can only process numbers, so we need to find a way to convert the raw text to numbers. That\\'s what the tokenizers do, and there are a lot of ways to go about this. The goal is to find the most meaningful representation — that is, the one that makes the most sense to the model — and, if possible, the smallest representation. Let\\'s take a look at some examples of tokenization algorithms, and try to answer some of the questions you may have about tokenization. ## Word-based[[word-based]]\\nThe first type of tokenizer that comes to mind is \\\\_word-based\\\\_. It\\'s generally very easy to set up and use with only a few rules, and it often yields decent results. For example, in the image below, the goal is to split the raw text into words and find a numerical representation for each of them:\\n\\n![An example of word-based tokenization.](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-course/documentation-images/resolve/main/en/chapter2/word_based_tokenization.svg)\\n![An example of word-based tokenization.](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-course/documentation-images/resolve/main/en/chapter2/word_based_tokenization-dark.svg)\\n\\nThere are different ways to split the text.

In this video, we will look at what actually happens when we use the pipeline function of the Transformers library. More specifically, we will look at the sentiment analysis pipeline, and how it went from the two following sentences to the positive labels with their respective scores. As we have seen in the pipeline presentation, there are three stages in the pipeline. First, we convert the raw texts to numbers the model can make sense of, using a tokenizer. Then, those numbers go through the model, which outputs logits. Finally, the post-processing steps transforms those logits into labels and scores. Let\\'s look in detail at those three steps, and how to replicate them using the Transformers library, beginning with the first stage, tokenization. The tokenization process has several steps. First, the text is split into small chunks called tokens. They can be words, parts of words or punctuation symbols. Then the tokenizer will had some special tokens (if the model expect them). Here the model uses expects a CLS token at the beginning and a SEP token at the end of the sentence to classify. Lastly, the tokenizer matches each token to its unique ID in the vocabulary of the pretrained model. To load such a tokenizer, the Transformers library provides the AutoTokenizer API. The most important method of this class is from\\\\_pretrained, which will download and cache the configuration and the vocabulary associated to a given checkpoint. Here, the checkpoint used by default for the sentiment analysis pipeline is distilbert base uncased finetuned sst2 english. We instantiate a tokenizer associated with that checkpoint, then feed it the two sentences. Since those two sentences are not of the same size, we will need to pad the shortest one to be able to build an array. This is done by the tokenizer with the option padding=True. With truncation=True, we ensure that any sentence longer than the maximum the model can handle is truncated. Lastly, the return\\\\_tensors option tells the tokenizer to return a PyTorch tensor.', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': 'a7d0e6d6-502d-47c6-bb34-989d180217e1', 'tool_call_id': 'call_votiQjW3EU036MGBKNFKVpom', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '6899bb92af3d2ebb270a0a21', 'page_content': 'p align=\"center\">\\n\\n![](https://huggingface.co/landing/assets/tokenizers/tokenizers-logo.png)\\n\\n![Build](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/workflows/Rust/badge.svg)\\n[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/huggingface/tokenizers.svg?color=blue)](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/blob/master/LICENSE)\\n[![Doc](https://docs.rs/tokenizers/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/tokenizers/)\\n\\nThe core of `tokenizers`, written in Rust.

However, it is important to note that the additional forward and backward passes introduced by gradient accumulation can\\nslow down the training process. You can enable gradient accumulation by adding the `gradient\\\\_accumulation\\\\_steps` argument to [`TrainingArguments`]:\\n```py\\ntraining\\\\_args = TrainingArguments(per\\\\_device\\\\_train\\\\_batch\\\\_size=1, gradient\\\\_accumulation\\\\_steps=4, \\\\*\\\\*default\\\\_args)\\n```\\nIn the above example, your effective batch size becomes 4.\", 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689ab3993e684812d15f68e1', 'page_content': 'It was run on a single NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB GPU with a prompt length of 512.

Make sure to [read the Guide to Blocks first](https://gradio.app/guides/quickstart/#blocks-more-flexibility-and-control). This guide covers auto reloading, reloading in a Python IDE, and using gradio with Jupyter Notebooks. ## Why Auto-Reloading? When you are building a Gradio demo, particularly out of Blocks, you may find it cumbersome to keep re-running your code to test your changes. To make it faster and more convenient to write your code, we\\'ve made it easier to \"reload\" your Gradio apps instantly when you are developing in a \\\\*\\\\*Python IDE\\\\*\\\\* (like VS Code, Sublime Text, PyCharm, or so on) or generally running your Python code from the terminal. We\\'ve also developed an analogous \"magic command\" that allows you to re-run cells faster if you use \\\\*\\\\*Jupyter Notebooks\\\\*\\\\* (or any similar environment like Colab). This short Guide will cover both of these methods, so no matter how you write Python, you\\'ll leave knowing how to build Gradio apps faster. ## Python IDE Reload 🔥\\nIf you are building Gradio Blocks using a Python IDE, your file of code (let\\'s name it `run.py`) might look something like this:\\n```python\\nimport gradio as gr\\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\\ngr.Markdown(\"# Greetings from Gradio!\")\\ninp = gr.Textbox(placeholder=\"What is your name?\")\\nout = gr.Textbox()\\ninp.change(fn=lambda x: f\"Welcome, {x}!\",\\ninputs=inp,\\noutputs=out)\\nif \\\\_\\\\_name\\\\_\\\\_ == \"\\\\_\\\\_main\\\\_\\\\_\":\\ndemo.launch()\\n```\\nThe problem is that anytime that you want to make a change to your layout, events, or components, you have to close and rerun your app by writing `python run.py`.\\n\\nBy default, the Gradio use UTF-8 encoding for scripts. \\\\*\\\\*For reload mode\\\\*\\\\*, If you are using encoding formats other than UTF-8 (such as cp1252), make sure you\\'ve done like this:\\n1. Configure encoding declaration of python script, for example: `# -\\\\*- coding: cp1252 -\\\\*-`\\n2. Confirm that your code editor has identified that encoding format. 3. Run like this: `gradio run.py --encoding cp1252`\\n🔥 If your application accepts command line arguments, you can pass them in as well. Here\\'s an example:\\n```python\\nimport gradio as gr\\nimport argparse\\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\\nparser.add\\\\_argument(\"--name\", type=str, default=\"User\")\\nargs, unknown = parser.parse\\\\_known\\\\_args()\\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\\ngr.Markdown(f\"# Greetings {args.name}!\")\\ninp = gr.Textbox()\\nout = gr.Textbox()\\ninp.change(fn=lambda x: x, inputs=inp, outputs=out)\\nif \\\\_\\\\_name\\\\_\\\\_ == \"\\\\_\\\\_main\\\\_\\\\_\":\\ndemo.launch()\\n```\\nWhich you could run like this: `gradio run.py --name Gretel`\\nAs a small aside, this auto-reloading happens if you change your `run.py` source code or the Gradio source code.\\n\\nWARNING: The --reload flag should not be used in production on Windows. ```\\n这里最重要的一行是 `正在观察 ...`。这里发生的情况是 Gradio 将观察 `run.py` 文件所在的目录，如果文件发生更改，它将自动为您重新运行文件。因此，您只需专注于编写代码，Gradio 演示将自动刷新 🥳\\n⚠️ 警告：`gradio` 命令不会检测传递给 `launch()` 方法的参数，因为在重新加载模式下从未调用 `launch()` 方法。例如，设置 `launch()` 中的 `auth` 或 `show\\\\_error` 不会在应用程序中反映出来。\\n当您使用重新加载模式时，请记住一件重要的事情：Gradio 专门查找名为 `demo` 的 Gradio Blocks/Interface 演示。如果您将演示命名为其他名称，您需要在代码中的第二个参数中传入演示的 FastAPI 应用程序的名称。对于 Gradio 演示，可以使用 `.app` 属性访问 FastAPI 应用程序。因此，如果您的 `run.py` 文件如下所示：\\n```python\\nimport gradio as gr\\nwith gr.Blocks() as my\\\\_demo:\\ngr.Markdown(\"# 来自Gradio的问候！\")\\ninp = gr.Textbox(placeholder=\"您叫什么名字？\")\\nout = gr.Textbox()\\ninp.change(fn=lambda x: f\"欢迎，{x}！\",\\ninputs=inp,\\noutputs=out)\\nif \\\\_\\\\_name\\\\_\\\\_ == \"\\\\_\\\\_main\\\\_\\\\_\":\\nmy\\\\_demo.launch()\\n```\\n那么您可以这样启动它：`gradio run.py my\\\\_demo.app`。\\nGradio默认使用UTF-8编码格式。对于\\\\*\\\\*重新加载模式\\\\*\\\\*，如果你的脚本使用的是除UTF-8以外的编码（如GBK）：\\n1. 在Python脚本的编码声明处指定你想要的编码格式，如：`# -\\\\*- coding: gbk -\\\\*-`\\n2. 确保你的代码编辑器识别到该格式。\\n3. 执行：`gradio run.py --encoding gbk`\\n🔥 如果您的应用程序接受命令行参数，您也可以传递它们。下面是一个例子：\\n```python\\nimport gradio as gr\\nimport argparse\\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\\nparser.add\\\\_argument(\"--name\", type=str, default=\"User\")\\nargs, unknown = parser.parse\\\\_known\\\\_args()\\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\\ngr.Markdown(f\"# 欢迎 {args.name}！\")\\ninp = gr.Textbox()\\nout = gr.Textbox()\\ninp.change(fn=lambda x: x, inputs=inp, outputs=out)\\nif \\\\_\\\\_name\\\\_\\\\_ == \"\\\\_\\\\_main\\\\_\\\\_\":\\ndemo.launch()\\n```\\n您可以像这样运行它：`gradio run.py --name Gretel`\\n作为一个小提示，只要更改了 `run.py` 源代码或 Gradio 源代码，自动重新加载就会发生。这意味着如果您决定[为 Gradio 做贡献](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)，这将非常有用 ✅\\n## Jupyter Notebook 魔法命令🔮\\n如果您使用 Jupyter Notebooks（或 Colab Notebooks 等）进行开发，我们也为您提供了一个解决方案！\\n我们开发了一个 \\\\*\\\\*magic command 魔法命令\\\\*\\\\*，可以为您创建和运行一个 Blocks 演示。要使用此功能，在笔记本顶部加载 gradio 扩展：\\n`%load\\\\_ext gradio`\\n然后，在您正在开发 Gradio 演示的单元格中，只需在顶部写入魔法命令\\\\*\\\\*`%%blocks`\\\\*\\\\*，然后像平常一样编写布局和组件：\\n```py\\n%%blocks\\nimport gradio as gr\\ngr.Markdown(\"# 来自Gradio的问候！\")\\ninp = gr.Textbox(placeholder=\"您叫什么名字？\")\\nout = gr.Textbox()\\ninp.change(fn=lambda x: f\"欢迎，{x}！\",\\ninputs=inp,\\noutputs=out)\\n```\\n请注意：\\n- 您不需要放置样板代码 `with gr.Blocks() as demo:` 和 `demo.launch()` — Gradio 会自动为您完成！\\n- 每次重新运行单元格时，Gradio 都将在相同的端口上重新启动您的应用程序，并使用相同的底层网络服务器。这意味着您将比正常重新运行单元格更快地看到变化。\\n下面是在 Jupyter Notebook 中的示例：\\n![](https://i.ibb.co/nrszFws/Blocks.gif)\\n🪄这在 colab 笔记本中也适用！[这是一个 colab 笔记本](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jUlX1w7JqckRHVE-nbDyMPyZ7fYD8488?authuser=1#scrollTo=zxHYjbCTTz\\\\_5)，您可以在其中看到 Blocks 魔法效果。尝试进行一些更改并重新运行带有 Gradio 代码的单元格！\\nNotebook Magic 现在是作者构建 Gradio 演示的首选方式。无论您如何编写 Python 代码，我们都希望这两种方法都能为您提供更好的 Gradio 开发体验。\\n---\\n## 下一步\\n既然您已经了解了如何使用 Gradio 快速开发，请开始构建自己的应用程序吧！\\n如果你正在寻找灵感，请尝试浏览其他人用 Gradio 构建的演示，[浏览 Hugging Face Spaces](http://hf.space/) 🤗', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': '45f8df25-0432-4fb8-b2e6-b7f2e426d6d8', 'tool_call_id': 'call_1Jsa8obscbNz0dRm1XIyD4Mk', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '6899c2f2666af48523f52222', 'page_content': 'Developing Faster with Auto-Reloading\\n\\\\*\\\\*Prerequisite\\\\*\\\\*: This Guide requires you to know about Blocks.

Pretraining Wav2Vec2 is rather complex, so it is highly recommended to read the\\n[official paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11477). JAX/Flax allows you to trace pure functions and compile them into efficient, fused accelerator code on both GPU and TPU. Models written in JAX/Flax are \\\\*\\\\*immutable\\\\*\\\\* and updated in a purely functional\\nway which enables simple and efficient model parallelism. `run\\\\_wav2vec2\\\\_pretrain\\\\_flax.py` is a lightweight example of how to download and preprocess a dataset from the 🤗 Datasets library or use your own files (jsonlines or csv), then pretrain the wav2vec2 architectures above on it. For custom datasets in `jsonlines` format please see: [the Datasets documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/loading\\\\_datasets#json-files) and you also will find examples of these below. Let\\'s start by creating a model repository to save the trained model and logs. Here we call the model `\"wav2vec2-base-robust\"`, but you can change the model name as you like. You can do this either directly on [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/new) (assuming that\\nyou are logged in) or via the command line:\\n```\\nhuggingface-cli repo create wav2vec2-base-robust\\n```\\nNext we clone the model repository to add the tokenizer and model files. ```\\ngit clone https://huggingface.co//wav2vec2-base-robust\\n```\\nTo ensure that all tensorboard traces will be uploaded correctly, we need to\\ntrack them. You can run the following command inside your model repo to do so. ```\\ncd wav2vec2-base-robust\\ngit lfs track \"\\\\*tfevents\\\\*\"\\n```\\nGreat, we have set up our model repository. During training, we will automatically\\npush the training logs and model weights to the repo. Next, let\\'s add a symbolic link to the `run\\\\_wav2vec2\\\\_pretrain\\\\_flax`. ```bash\\nexport MODEL\\\\_DIR=\"./wav2vec2-base-robust\"\\nln -s ~/transformers/examples/research\\\\_projects/jax-projects/wav2vec2/run\\\\_wav2vec2\\\\_pretrain\\\\_flax.py ./\\n```\\n### Create the model configuration\\nLet\\'s first create the model configuration and store it in the model repository.\\n\\n!---\\nCopyright 2021 The HuggingFace Team.

In the script [`run\\\\_speech\\\\_wav2vec2\\\\_pretraining\\\\_no\\\\_trainer`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/pytorch/speech-pretraining/run\\\\_wav2vec2\\\\_pretraining\\\\_no\\\\_trainer.py), a Wav2Vec2 model is pre-trained on audio data alone using [Wav2Vec2\\'s contrastive loss objective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11477). The following examples show how to fine-tune a `\"base\"`-sized Wav2Vec2 model as well as a `\"large\"`-sized Wav2Vec2 model using [`accelerate`](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate). ---\\n\\\\*\\\\*NOTE 1\\\\*\\\\*\\nWav2Vec2\\'s pre-training is known to be quite unstable. It is advised to do a couple of test runs with a smaller dataset,\\n\\\\*i.e.\\\\* `--dataset\\\\_config\\\\_names clean clean`, `--dataset\\\\_split\\\\_names validation test`\\nto find good hyper-parameters for `learning\\\\_rate`, `batch\\\\_size`, `num\\\\_warmup\\\\_steps`,\\nand the optimizer. A good metric to observe during training is the gradient norm which should ideally be between 0.5 and 2. ---\\n---\\n\\\\*\\\\*NOTE 2\\\\*\\\\*\\nWhen training a model on large datasets it is recommended to run the data preprocessing\\nin a first run in a \\\\*\\\\*non-distributed\\\\*\\\\* mode via `--preprocessing\\\\_only` so that\\nwhen running the model in \\\\*\\\\*distributed\\\\*\\\\* mode in a second step the preprocessed data\\ncan easily be loaded on each distributed device. ---\\n### Demo\\nIn this demo run we pre-train a `\"base-sized\"` Wav2Vec2 model simply only on the validation\\nand test data of [librispeech\\\\_asr](https://huggingface.co/datasets/librispeech\\\\_asr).

The abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*We show for the first time that learning powerful representations from speech audio alone followed by fine-tuning on\\ntranscribed speech can outperform the best semi-supervised methods while being conceptually simpler. wav2vec 2.0 masks\\nthe speech input in the latent space and solves a contrastive task defined over a quantization of the latent\\nrepresentations which are jointly learned. Experiments using all labeled data of Librispeech achieve 1.8/3.3 WER on the\\nclean/other test sets.

Pretraining Wav2Vec2 is rather complex, so it is highly recommended to read the\\n[official paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11477). JAX/Flax allows you to trace pure functions and compile them into efficient, fused accelerator code on both GPU and TPU. Models written in JAX/Flax are \\\\*\\\\*immutable\\\\*\\\\* and updated in a purely functional\\nway which enables simple and efficient model parallelism. `run\\\\_wav2vec2\\\\_pretrain\\\\_flax.py` is a lightweight example of how to download and preprocess a dataset from the 🤗 Datasets library or use your own files (jsonlines or csv), then pretrain the wav2vec2 architectures above on it. For custom datasets in `jsonlines` format please see: [the Datasets documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/loading\\\\_datasets#json-files) and you also will find examples of these below. Let\\'s start by creating a model repository to save the trained model and logs. Here we call the model `\"wav2vec2-base-robust\"`, but you can change the model name as you like. You can do this either directly on [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/new) (assuming that\\nyou are logged in) or via the command line:\\n```\\nhuggingface-cli repo create wav2vec2-base-robust\\n```\\nNext we clone the model repository to add the tokenizer and model files. ```\\ngit clone https://huggingface.co//wav2vec2-base-robust\\n```\\nTo ensure that all tensorboard traces will be uploaded correctly, we need to\\ntrack them. You can run the following command inside your model repo to do so. ```\\ncd wav2vec2-base-robust\\ngit lfs track \"\\\\*tfevents\\\\*\"\\n```\\nGreat, we have set up our model repository. During training, we will automatically\\npush the training logs and model weights to the repo. Next, let\\'s add a symbolic link to the `run\\\\_wav2vec2\\\\_pretrain\\\\_flax`. ```bash\\nexport MODEL\\\\_DIR=\"./wav2vec2-base-robust\"\\nln -s ~/transformers/examples/research\\\\_projects/jax-projects/wav2vec2/run\\\\_wav2vec2\\\\_pretrain\\\\_flax.py ./\\n```\\n### Create the model configuration\\nLet\\'s first create the model configuration and store it in the model repository.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689ab1563e684812d15f6645', 'page_content': '!---\\nCopyright 2021 The HuggingFace Team.

More specifically, we will look at the sentiment analysis pipeline, and how it went from the two following sentences to the positive labels with their respective scores. As we have seen in the pipeline presentation, there are three stages in the pipeline. First, we convert the raw texts to numbers the model can make sense of, using a tokenizer.

Let\\'s look in detail at those three steps, and how to replicate them using the Transformers library, beginning with the first stage, tokenization. The tokenization process has several steps. First, the text is split into small chunks called tokens. They can be words, parts of words or punctuation symbols. Then the tokenizer will had some special tokens (if the model expect them).

Click on it to open a Google Colab notebook with all the code samples of this section. This button will be present in any section containing code examples. If you want to run the examples locally, we recommend taking a look at the [setup](/course/chapter0). ## Transformers are everywhere![[transformers-are-everywhere]]\\nTransformer models are used to solve all kinds of NLP tasks, like the ones mentioned in the previous section. Here are some of the companies and organizations using Hugging Face and Transformer models, who also contribute back to the community by sharing their models:\\n![Companies using Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-course/documentation-images/resolve/main/en/chapter1/companies.PNG)\\nThe [🤗 Transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) provides the functionality to create and use those shared models. The [Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) contains thousands of pretrained models that anyone can download and use. You can also upload your own models to the Hub! ⚠️ The Hugging Face Hub is not limited to Transformer models. Anyone can share any kind of models or datasets they want! [Create a huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/join) account to benefit from all available features! Before diving into how Transformer models work under the hood, let\\'s look at a few examples of how they can be used to solve some interesting NLP problems. ## Working with pipelines[[working-with-pipelines]]\\nThe most basic object in the 🤗 Transformers library is the `pipeline()` function. It connects a model with its necessary preprocessing and postprocessing steps, allowing us to directly input any text and get an intelligible answer:\\n```python\\nfrom transformers import pipeline\\nclassifier = pipeline(\"sentiment-analysis\")\\nclassifier(\"I\\'ve been waiting for a HuggingFace course my whole life.\")\\n```\\n```python out\\n[{\\'label\\': \\'POSITIVE\\', \\'score\\': 0.9598047137260437}]\\n```\\nWe can even pass several sentences! ```python\\nclassifier(\\n[\"I\\'ve been waiting for a HuggingFace course my whole life.\", \"I hate this so much!\"]\\n)\\n```\\n```python out\\n[{\\'label\\': \\'POSITIVE\\', \\'score\\': 0.9598047137260437},\\n{\\'label\\': \\'NEGATIVE\\', \\'score\\': 0.9994558095932007}]\\n```\\nBy default, this pipeline selects a particular pretrained model that has been fine-tuned for sentiment analysis in English.', 'type': 'Document'}}], 'status': 'success'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'messages', 'AIMessage'], 'kwargs': {'content': 'The default checkpoint used by the sentiment analysis pipeline in the Transformers library is \"distilbert base uncased finetuned sst2 english.\"', 'response_metadata': {'finish_reason': 'stop', 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_34a54ae93c'}, 'type': 'ai', 'id': 'run--eec4b3c4-62b0-4aae-ad9b-cee4257ea8e1-0', 'usage_metadata': {'input_tokens': 1677, 'output_tokens': 29, 'total_tokens': 1706, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}, 'tool_calls': [], 'invalid_tool_calls': []}}], 'chat_history': []}\n"

To start, create a Python file and import `torch.distributed` and `torch.multiprocessing` to set up the distributed process group and to spawn the processes for inference on each GPU. You should also initialize a [`DiffusionPipeline`]:\\n```py\\nimport torch\\nimport torch.distributed as dist\\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\\nfrom diffusers import DiffusionPipeline\\nsd = DiffusionPipeline.from\\\\_pretrained(\\n\"runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5\", torch\\\\_dtype=torch.float16, use\\\\_safetensors=True\\n)\\n```\\nYou\\'ll want to create a function to run inference; [`init\\\\_process\\\\_group`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html?highlight=init\\\\_process\\\\_group#torch.distributed.init\\\\_process\\\\_group) handles creating a distributed environment with the type of backend to use, the `rank` of the current process, and the `world\\\\_size` or the number of processes participating. If you\\'re running inference in parallel over 2 GPUs, then the `world\\\\_size` is 2. Move the [`DiffusionPipeline`] to `rank` and use `get\\\\_rank` to assign a GPU to each process, where each process handles a different prompt:\\n```py\\ndef run\\\\_inference(rank, world\\\\_size):\\ndist.init\\\\_process\\\\_group(\"nccl\", rank=rank, world\\\\_size=world\\\\_size)\\nsd.to(rank)\\nif torch.distributed.get\\\\_rank() == 0:\\nprompt = \"a dog\"\\nelif torch.distributed.get\\\\_rank() == 1:\\nprompt = \"a cat\"\\nimage = sd(prompt).images[0]\\nimage.save(f\"./{\\'\\\\_\\'.join(prompt)}.png\")\\n```\\nTo run the distributed inference, call [`mp.spawn`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/multiprocessing.html#torch.multiprocessing.spawn) to run the `run\\\\_inference` function on the number of GPUs defined in `world\\\\_size`:\\n```py\\ndef main():\\nworld\\\\_size = 2\\nmp.spawn(run\\\\_inference, args=(world\\\\_size,), nprocs=world\\\\_size, join=True)\\nif \\\\_\\\\_name\\\\_\\\\_ == \"\\\\_\\\\_main\\\\_\\\\_\":\\nmain()\\n```\\nOnce you\\'ve completed the inference script, use the `--nproc\\\\_per\\\\_node` argument to specify the number of GPUs to use and call `torchrun` to run the script:\\n```bash\\ntorchrun run\\\\_distributed.py --nproc\\\\_per\\\\_node=2\\n```\\n\\nAgain, remember to ensure to adjust `TORCH\\\\_CUDA\\\\_ARCH\\\\_LIST` to the target architectures. You can find the complete list of NVIDIA GPUs and their corresponding \\\\*\\\\*Compute Capabilities\\\\*\\\\* (same as arch in this\\ncontext) [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus). You can check the archs pytorch was built with using:\\n```bash\\npython -c \"import torch; print(torch.cuda.get\\\\_arch\\\\_list())\"\\n```\\nHere is how to find out the arch for one of the installed GPUs. For example, for GPU 0:\\n```bash\\nCUDA\\\\_VISIBLE\\\\_DEVICES=0 python -c \"import torch; \\\\\\nprint(torch.cuda.get\\\\_device\\\\_properties(torch.device(\\'cuda\\')))\"\\n```\\nIf the output is:\\n```bash\\n\\\\_CudaDeviceProperties(name=\\'GeForce RTX 3090\\', major=8, minor=6, total\\\\_memory=24268MB, multi\\\\_processor\\\\_count=82)\\n```\\nthen you know that this card\\'s arch is `8.6`. You can also leave `TORCH\\\\_CUDA\\\\_ARCH\\\\_LIST` out completely and then the build program will automatically query the\\narchitecture of the GPUs the build is made on. This may or may not match the GPUs on the target machines, that\\'s why\\nit\\'s best to specify the desired archs explicitly. If after trying everything suggested you still encounter build issues, please, proceed with the GitHub Issue of\\n[Deepspeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed/issues),\\n### Deployment with multiple GPUs\\nTo deploy the DeepSpeed integration adjust the [`Trainer`] command line arguments to include a new argument `--deepspeed ds\\\\_config.json`, where `ds\\\\_config.json` is the DeepSpeed configuration file as\\ndocumented [here](https://www.deepspeed.ai/docs/config-json/).\\n\\nNow we can fit very large models into a single GPU, but the training might still be very slow. The simplest strategy in this scenario is data parallelism: we replicate the same training setup into separate GPUs and pass different batches to each GPU. With this, you can parallelize the forward/backward passes of the model and scale with the number of GPUs. ![chapter10\\\\_ddp.png](https://huggingface.co/datasets/trl-internal-testing/example-images/resolve/main/blog/stackllama/chapter10\\\\_ddp.png)\\nWe use either the `transformers.Trainer` or `accelerate`, which both support data parallelism without any code changes, by simply passing arguments when calling the scripts with `torchrun` or `accelerate launch`. The following runs a training script with 8 GPUs on a single machine with `accelerate` and `torchrun`, respectively. ```bash\\naccelerate launch --multi\\\\_gpu --num\\\\_machines 1 --num\\\\_processes 8 my\\\\_accelerate\\\\_script.py\\ntorchrun --nnodes 1 --nproc\\\\_per\\\\_node 8 my\\\\_torch\\\\_script.py\\n```\\n## Supervised fine-tuning\\nBefore we start training reward models and tuning our model with RL, it helps if the model is already good in the domain we are interested in.', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': '4538159d-24bf-4d2b-9601-0c6788ac2149', 'tool_call_id': 'call_TsVZgzgpLIRuhIwYumu5lpak', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '689aa85f3e684812d15f5be4', 'page_content': '## PyTorch Distributed\\nPyTorch supports [`DistributedDataParallel`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel.html) which enables data parallelism.

Move the [`DiffusionPipeline`] to `rank` and use `get\\\\_rank` to assign a GPU to each process, where each process handles a different prompt:\\n```py\\ndef run\\\\_inference(rank, world\\\\_size):\\ndist.init\\\\_process\\\\_group(\"nccl\", rank=rank, world\\\\_size=world\\\\_size)\\nsd.to(rank)\\nif torch.distributed.get\\\\_rank() == 0:\\nprompt = \"a dog\"\\nelif torch.distributed.get\\\\_rank() == 1:\\nprompt = \"a cat\"\\nimage = sd(prompt).images[0]\\nimage.save(f\"./{\\'\\\\_\\'.join(prompt)}.png\")\\n```\\nTo run the distributed inference, call [`mp.spawn`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/multiprocessing.html#torch.multiprocessing.spawn) to run the `run\\\\_inference` function on the number of GPUs defined in `world\\\\_size`:\\n```py\\ndef main():\\nworld\\\\_size = 2\\nmp.spawn(run\\\\_inference, args=(world\\\\_size,), nprocs=world\\\\_size, join=True)\\nif \\\\_\\\\_name\\\\_\\\\_ == \"\\\\_\\\\_main\\\\_\\\\_\":\\nmain()\\n```\\nOnce you\\'ve completed the inference script, use the `--nproc\\\\_per\\\\_node` argument to specify the number of GPUs to use and call `torchrun` to run the script:\\n```bash\\ntorchrun run\\\\_distributed.py --nproc\\\\_per\\\\_node=2\\n```', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'id': '6899be74666af48523f51c96', 'page_content': 'Again, remember to ensure to adjust `TORCH\\\\_CUDA\\\\_ARCH\\\\_LIST` to the target architectures.

You can always upgrade installed packages and a custom packages by adding a `requirements.txt` file to your model repository. Read more in [Add custom Dependencies](/docs/inference-endpoints/guides/custom\\\\_dependencies). ## Installed packages & version\\nThe installed packages are split into `general`, `CPU` & `GPU` packages. The `general` packages are installed in all containers, the `CPU` and `GPU` packages are only installed in the corresponding containers. The Hugging Face Inference Runtime has separate versions for `PyTorch` and `TensorFlow` for `CPU` and `GPU`, which are used based on the selected `framework` when creating an Inference Endpoint. The `TensorFlow` and `PyTorch` flavors are grouped together in the list below. ### General\\n- `Python`: `3.9.13`\\n### CPU\\n- `transformers[sklearn,sentencepiece,audio,vision]`: `4.27.2`\\n- `diffusers`: `0.14.0`\\n- `accelerate`: `0.17.1`\\n- `sentence\\\\_transformers`: `latest`\\n- `pandas`: `latest`\\n- `pytorch`: `1.13.1`\\n- `torchvision`: `0.14.1`\\n- `tensorflow`: `2.9.1`\\n### GPU\\n- `transformers[sklearn,sentencepiece,audio,vision]`: `4.27.2`\\n- `diffusers`: `0.14.0`\\n- `accelerate`: `0.17.1`\\n- `sentence\\\\_transformers`: `latest`\\n- `pandas`: `latest`\\n- `pytorch`: `1.13.1=py3.9\\\\_cuda11.8\\\\*`\\n- `torchvision`: `0.14.1`\\n- `tensorflow`: `2.9.1=\\\\*cuda112\\\\*py39\\\\*`\\n\\nCreate custom Inference Handler\\nHugging Face Endpoints supports all of the Transformers and Sentence-Transformers tasks and can support custom tasks, including custom pre- & post-processing. The customization can be done through a [handler.py](https://huggingface.co/philschmid/distilbert-onnx-banking77/blob/main/handler.py) file in your model repository on the Hugging Face Hub. The [handler.py](https://huggingface.co/philschmid/distilbert-onnx-banking77/blob/main/handler.py) needs to implement the [EndpointHandler](https://huggingface.co/philschmid/distilbert-onnx-banking77/blob/main/handler.py) class with a `\\\\_\\\\_init\\\\_\\\\_` and a `\\\\_\\\\_call\\\\_\\\\_` method.

However, training them at scale often requires a large amount of computing power, making the whole process unnecessarily long, complex, and costly. Today, [Habana® Labs](https://habana.ai/), a pioneer in high-efficiency, purpose-built deep learning processors, and Hugging Face, the home of [Transformer](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) models, are happy to announce that they’re joining forces to make it easier and quicker to train high-quality transformer models. Thanks to the integration of Habana’s [SynapseAI software suite](https://habana.ai/training-software/) with the Hugging Face [Optimum open-source library](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum), data scientists and machine learning engineers can now accelerate their Transformer training jobs on Habana processors with just a few lines of code and enjoy greater productivity as well as lower training cost. [Habana Gaudi](https://habana.ai/training/) training solutions, which power Amazon’s EC2 DL1 instances and Supermicro’s X12 Gaudi AI Training Server, deliver price/performance up to 40% lower than comparable training solutions and enable customers to train more while spending less. The integration of ten 100 Gigabit Ethernet ports onto every Gaudi processor enables system scaling from 1 to thousands of Gaudis with ease and cost-efficiency. Habana’s SynapseAI® is optimized—at inception—to enable Gaudi performance and usability, supports TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks, with a focus on computer vision and natural language processing applications. With 60,000+ stars on Github, 30,000+ models, and millions of monthly visits, Hugging Face is one of the fastest-growing projects in open source software history, and the go-to place for the machine learning community. With its [Hardware Partner Program](https://huggingface.co/hardware), Hugging Face provides Gaudi’s advanced deep learning hardware with the ultimate Transformer toolset. This partnership will enable rapid expansion of the Habana Gaudi training transformer model library, bringing Gaudi efficiency and ease of use to a wide array of customer use cases like natural language processing, computer vision, speech, and more. “\\\\*We’re excited to partner with Hugging Face and its many open-source developers to address the growing demand for transformer models that benefit from the efficiency, usability, and scalability of the Gaudi training platform\\\\*”, said Sree Ganesan, head of software product management, Habana Labs. “Habana Gaudi brings a new level of efficiency to deep learning model training, and we’re super excited to make this performance easily accessible to Transformer users with minimal code changes through Optimum”, said Jeff Boudier, product director at Hugging Face. To learn how to get started training with Habana Gaudi, please visit [https://developer.habana.ai](https://developer.habana.ai).\\n\\n--\\ntitle: \"Intel and Hugging Face Partner to Democratize Machine Learning Hardware Acceleration\"\\nthumbnail: /blog/assets/80\\\\_intel/01.png\\nauthors:\\n- user: juliensimon\\n---\\n# Intel and Hugging Face Partner to Democratize Machine Learning Hardware Acceleration\\n![image](assets/80\\\\_intel/01.png)\\nThe mission of Hugging Face is to democratize good machine learning and maximize its positive impact across industries and society.

However, training them at scale often requires a large amount of computing power, making the whole process unnecessarily long, complex, and costly. Today, [Habana® Labs](https://habana.ai/), a pioneer in high-efficiency, purpose-built deep learning processors, and Hugging Face, the home of [Transformer](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) models, are happy to announce that they’re joining forces to make it easier and quicker to train high-quality transformer models. Thanks to the integration of Habana’s [SynapseAI software suite](https://habana.ai/training-software/) with the Hugging Face [Optimum open-source library](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum), data scientists and machine learning engineers can now accelerate their Transformer training jobs on Habana processors with just a few lines of code and enjoy greater productivity as well as lower training cost. [Habana Gaudi](https://habana.ai/training/) training solutions, which power Amazon’s EC2 DL1 instances and Supermicro’s X12 Gaudi AI Training Server, deliver price/performance up to 40% lower than comparable training solutions and enable customers to train more while spending less. The integration of ten 100 Gigabit Ethernet ports onto every Gaudi processor enables system scaling from 1 to thousands of Gaudis with ease and cost-efficiency. Habana’s SynapseAI® is optimized—at inception—to enable Gaudi performance and usability, supports TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks, with a focus on computer vision and natural language processing applications. With 60,000+ stars on Github, 30,000+ models, and millions of monthly visits, Hugging Face is one of the fastest-growing projects in open source software history, and the go-to place for the machine learning community. With its [Hardware Partner Program](https://huggingface.co/hardware), Hugging Face provides Gaudi’s advanced deep learning hardware with the ultimate Transformer toolset. This partnership will enable rapid expansion of the Habana Gaudi training transformer model library, bringing Gaudi efficiency and ease of use to a wide array of customer use cases like natural language processing, computer vision, speech, and more. “\\\\*We’re excited to partner with Hugging Face and its many open-source developers to address the growing demand for transformer models that benefit from the efficiency, usability, and scalability of the Gaudi training platform\\\\*”, said Sree Ganesan, head of software product management, Habana Labs. “Habana Gaudi brings a new level of efficiency to deep learning model training, and we’re super excited to make this performance easily accessible to Transformer users with minimal code changes through Optimum”, said Jeff Boudier, product director at Hugging Face.

Let\\'s take a look at how we can rearrange Components. Under the hood, this layout structure uses the [flexbox model of web development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS\\\\_Flexible\\\\_Box\\\\_Layout/Basic\\\\_Concepts\\\\_of\\\\_Flexbox). ## Rows\\nElements within a `with gr.Row` clause will all be displayed horizontally. For example, to display two Buttons side by side:\\n```python\\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\\nwith gr.Row():\\nbtn1 = gr.Button(\"Button 1\")\\nbtn2 = gr.Button(\"Button 2\")\\n```\\nTo make every element in a Row have the same height, use the `equal\\\\_height` argument of the `style` method. ```python\\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\\nwith gr.Row(equal\\\\_height=True):\\ntextbox = gr.Textbox()\\nbtn2 = gr.Button(\"Button 2\")\\n```\\nThe widths of elements in a Row can be controlled via a combination of `scale` and `min\\\\_width` arguments that are present in every Component. - `scale` is an integer that defines how an element will take up space in a Row. If scale is set to `0`, and element will not expand to take up space. If scale is set to `1` or greater, the element well expand. Multiple elements in a row will expand proportional to their scale. Below, `btn1` will expand twice as much as `btn2`, while `btn0` will not expand at all:\\n```python\\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\\nwith gr.Row():\\nbtn0 = gr.Button(\"Button 0\", scale=0)\\nbtn1 = gr.Button(\"Button 1\", scale=1)\\nbtn2 = gr.Button(\"Button 2\", scale=2)\\n```\\n- `min\\\\_width` will set the minimum width the element will take.\\n\\nThe Row will wrap if there isn\\'t sufficient space to satisfy all `min\\\\_width` values. Learn more about Rows in the [docs](https://gradio.app/docs/#row). ## Columns and Nesting\\nComponents within a Column will be placed vertically atop each other. Since the vertical layout is the default layout for Blocks apps anyway, to be useful, Columns are usually nested within Rows. For example:\\n$code\\\\_rows\\\\_and\\\\_columns\\n$demo\\\\_rows\\\\_and\\\\_columns\\nSee how the first column has two Textboxes arranged vertically. The second column has an Image and Button arranged vertically. Notice how the relative widths of the two columns is set by the `scale` parameter. The column with twice the `scale` value takes up twice the width. Learn more about Columns in the [docs](https://gradio.app/docs/#column). # Dimensions\\nYou can control the height and width of various components, where the parameters are available. These parameters accept either a number (interpreted as pixels) or a string. Using a string allows the direct application of any CSS unit to the encapsulating Block element, catering to more specifc design requirements. When omitted, Gradio uses default dimensions suited for most use cases. Below is an example illustrating the use of viewport width (vw):\\n```python\\nimport gradio as gr\\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\\nim = gr.ImageEditor(\\nwidth=\"50vw\",\\n)\\ndemo.launch()\\n```\\nWhen using percentage values for dimensions, you may want to define a parent component with an absolute unit (e.g. `px` or `vw`). This approach ensures that child components with relative dimensions are sized appropriately:\\n```python\\nimport gradio as gr\\ncss = \"\"\"\\n.container {\\nheight: 100vh;\\n}\\n\"\"\"\\nwith gr.Blocks(css=css) as demo:\\nwith gr.Column(elem\\\\_classes=[\"container\"]):\\nname = gr.Chatbot(value=[[\"1\", \"2\"]], height=\"70%\")\\ndemo.launch()\\n```\\nIn this example, the Column layout component is given a height of 100% of the viewport height (100vh), and the Chatbot component inside it takes up 70% of the Column\\'s height.\\n\\nGradio Demo: blocks\\\\_group\\n```\\n!pip install -q gradio\\n```\\n```\\nimport gradio as gr\\ndef greet(name):\\nreturn \"Hello \" + name + \"!\"\\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\\ngr.Markdown(\"### This is a couple of elements without any gr.Group.
