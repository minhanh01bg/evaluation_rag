It\\'s the first paper that successfully trains a Transformer encoder on ImageNet, attaining\\nvery good results compared to familiar convolutional architectures. ViT hybrid is a slight variant of the [plain Vision Transformer](vit),\\nby leveraging a convolutional backbone (specifically, [BiT](bit)) whose features are used as initial \"tokens\" for the Transformer.\\n\\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*Mobile vision transformers (MobileViT) can achieve state-of-the-art performance across several mobile vision tasks, including classification and detection. Though these models have fewer parameters, they have high latency as compared to convolutional neural network-based models. The main efficiency bottleneck in MobileViT is the multi-headed self-attention (MHA) in transformers, which requires O(k2) time complexity with respect to the number of tokens (or patches) k. Moreover, MHA requires costly operations (e.g., batch-wise matrix multiplication) for computing self-attention, impacting latency on resource-constrained devices. This paper introduces a separable self-attention method with linear complexity, i.e. O(k). A simple yet effective characteristic of the proposed method is that it uses element-wise operations for computing self-attention, making it a good choice for resource-constrained devices. The improved model, MobileViTV2, is state-of-the-art on several mobile vision tasks, including ImageNet object classification and MS-COCO object detection. With about three million parameters, MobileViTV2 achieves a top-1 accuracy of 75.6% on the ImageNet dataset, outperforming MobileViT by about 1% while running 3.2× faster on a mobile device.\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [shehan97](https://huggingface.co/shehan97). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/apple/ml-cvnets). ## Usage tips\\n- MobileViTV2 is more like a CNN than a Transformer model.\\n\\nWith so many Transformer variants available, it can be easy to miss the bigger picture.

If you aren\\'t familiar with the original Transformer model or need a refresher, check out the [How do Transformers work](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/4?fw=pt) chapter from the Hugging Face course.## Computer vision\\n### Convolutional network\\nFor a long time, convolutional networks (CNNs) were the dominant paradigm for computer vision tasks until the [Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) demonstrated its scalability and efficiency. Even then, some of a CNN\\'s best qualities, like translation invariance, are so powerful (especially for certain tasks) that some Transformers incorporate convolutions in their architecture. [ConvNeXt](model\\\\_doc/convnext) flipped this exchange around and incorporated design choices from Transformers to modernize a CNN. For example, ConvNeXt uses non-overlapping sliding windows to patchify an image and a larger kernel to increase its global receptive field. ConvNeXt also makes several layer design choices to be more memory-efficient and improve performance, so it competes favorably with Transformers! ### Encoder[[cv-encoder]]\\nThe [Vision Transformer (ViT)](model\\\\_doc/vit) opened the door to computer vision tasks without convolutions. ViT uses a standard Transformer encoder, but its main breakthrough was how it treated an image. It splits an image into fixed-size patches and uses them to create an embedding, just like how a sentence is split into tokens. ViT capitalized on the Transformers\\' efficient architecture to demonstrate competitive results with the CNNs at the time while requiring fewer resources to train. ViT was soon followed by other vision models that could also handle dense vision tasks like segmentation as well as detection. One of these models is the [Swin](model\\\\_doc/swin) Transformer. It builds hierarchical feature maps (like a CNN 👀 and unlike ViT) from smaller-sized patches and merges them with neighboring patches in deeper layers. Attention is only computed within a local window, and the window is shifted between attention layers to create connections to help the model learn better. Since the Swin Transformer can produce hierarchical feature maps, it is a good candidate for dense prediction tasks like segmentation and detection. The [SegFormer](model\\\\_doc/segformer) also uses a Transformer encoder to build hierarchical feature maps, but it adds a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) decoder on top to combine all the feature maps and make a prediction. Other vision models, like BeIT and ViTMAE, drew inspiration from BERT\\'s pretraining objective. [BeIT](model\\\\_doc/beit) is pretrained by \\\\*masked image modeling (MIM)\\\\*; the image patches are randomly masked, and the image is also tokenized into visual tokens. BeIT is trained to predict the visual tokens corresponding to the masked patches.

You don\\'t need to indicate which\\ntoken belongs to which segment. Just separate your segments with the separation token `tokenizer.sep\\\\_token` (or\\n``). - A transformer model replacing the attention matrices by sparse matrices to go faster. Often, the local context (e.g., what are the two tokens left and right?) is enough to take action for a given token. Some preselected input tokens are still given global attention, but the attention matrix has way less parameters, resulting in a speed-up. See the local attention section for more information. ## Longformer Self Attention\\nLongformer self attention employs self attention on both a \"local\" context and a \"global\" context. Most tokens only\\nattend \"locally\" to each other meaning that each token attends to its \\\\\\\\(\\\\frac{1}{2} w\\\\\\\\) previous tokens and\\n\\\\\\\\(\\\\frac{1}{2} w\\\\\\\\) succeeding tokens with \\\\\\\\(w\\\\\\\\) being the window length as defined in\\n`config.attention\\\\_window`. Note that `config.attention\\\\_window` can be of type `List` to define a\\ndifferent \\\\\\\\(w\\\\\\\\) for each layer. A selected few tokens attend \"globally\" to all other tokens, as it is\\nconventionally done for all tokens in `BertSelfAttention`. Note that \"locally\" and \"globally\" attending tokens are projected by different query, key and value matrices. Also note\\nthat every \"locally\" attending token not only attends to tokens within its window \\\\\\\\(w\\\\\\\\), but also to all \"globally\"\\nattending tokens so that global attention is \\\\*symmetric\\\\*. The user can define which tokens attend \"locally\" and which tokens attend \"globally\" by setting the tensor\\n`global\\\\_attention\\\\_mask` at run-time appropriately. All Longformer models employ the following logic for\\n`global\\\\_attention\\\\_mask`:\\n- 0: the token attends \"locally\",\\n- 1: the token attends \"globally\". For more information please also refer to [`~LongformerModel.forward`] method. Using Longformer self attention, the memory and time complexity of the query-key matmul operation, which usually\\nrepresents the memory and time bottleneck, can be reduced from \\\\\\\\(\\\\mathcal{O}(n\\\\_s \\\\times n\\\\_s)\\\\\\\\) to\\n\\\\\\\\(\\\\mathcal{O}(n\\\\_s \\\\times w)\\\\\\\\), with \\\\\\\\(n\\\\_s\\\\\\\\) being the sequence length and \\\\\\\\(w\\\\\\\\) being the average window\\nsize.\\n\\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*Transformers have emerged as a powerful tool for a broad range of natural language processing tasks. A key component\\nthat drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or\\ndependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the\\ninput sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences -- a topic being actively studied in the\\ncommunity. To address this limitation, we propose Nyströmformer -- a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a\\nfunction of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nyström method to approximate standard self-attention\\nwith O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nyströmformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of\\ntokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard\\nsequence length, and find that our Nyströmformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than\\nstandard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nyströmformer performs\\nfavorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.

You don\\'t need to indicate which\\ntoken belongs to which segment. Just separate your segments with the separation token `tokenizer.sep\\\\_token` (or\\n``). - A transformer model replacing the attention matrices by sparse matrices to go faster. Often, the local context (e.g., what are the two tokens left and right?) is enough to take action for a given token. Some preselected input tokens are still given global attention, but the attention matrix has way less parameters, resulting in a speed-up.

Using DistilBERT is very similar to using BERT. DistilBERT share the same tokenizer as BERT\\'s `bert-base-uncased` even though we provide a link to this tokenizer under the `DistilBertTokenizer` name to have a consistent naming between the library models. ```python\\ntokenizer = DistilBertTokenizer.from\\\\_pretrained(\\'distilbert-base-cased\\')\\nmodel = DistilBertModel.from\\\\_pretrained(\\'distilbert-base-cased\\')\\ninput\\\\_ids = torch.tensor(tokenizer.encode(\"Hello, my dog is cute\")).unsqueeze(0)\\noutputs = model(input\\\\_ids)\\nlast\\\\_hidden\\\\_states = outputs[0] # The last hidden-state is the first element of the output tuple\\n```\\nSimilarly, using the other Distil\\\\* models simply consists in calling the base classes with a different pretrained checkpoint:\\n- DistilBERT uncased: `model = DistilBertModel.from\\\\_pretrained(\\'distilbert-base-uncased\\')`\\n- DistilGPT2: `model = GPT2Model.from\\\\_pretrained(\\'distilgpt2\\')`\\n- DistilRoBERTa: `model = RobertaModel.from\\\\_pretrained(\\'distilroberta-base\\')`\\n- DistilmBERT: `model = DistilBertModel.from\\\\_pretrained(\\'distilbert-base-multilingual-cased\\')`\\n## How to train Distil\\\\*\\nIn the following, we will explain how you can train DistilBERT.\\n\\nThis is\\nalso a seeting where we only have `K=4` possible labels. The higher the number of classes for a given task, the more\\ndrastic the speedup will be, since the zero-shot teacher\\'s complexity scales linearly with the number of classes. Since we secretly have access to ground truth labels for AG\\'s news, we can evaluate the accuracy of each model. The\\noriginal zero-shot model `roberta-large-mnli` gets an accuracy of 69.3% on the held-out test set. After training a\\nstudent on the unlabeled training set, the distilled model gets a similar score of 70.4%. Lastly, you can share the distilled model with the community and/or use it with our inference API by [uploading it\\nto the 🤗 Hub](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model\\\\_sharing.html). We\\'ve uploaded the distilled model from this\\nexample at\\n[joeddav/distilbert-base-uncased-agnews-student](https://huggingface.co/joeddav/distilbert-base-uncased-agnews-student).\\n\\nIn our experiments, we initialized our model from a few layers of the teacher (Bert) itself! Please refer to `scripts/extract.py` and `scripts/extract\\\\_distilbert.py` to create a valid initialization checkpoint and use `--student\\\\_pretrained\\\\_weights` argument to use this initialization for the distilled training!

For NER tasks the model reaches a F1 score of 83.49 on the CoNLL-2003 test set (for comparison, `bert-base-german-dbmdz-cased` reaches a 84.52 F1 score), and a F1 score of 85.23 on the GermEval 2014 test set (`bert-base-german-dbmdz-cased` reaches a 86.89 F1 score). - `distilgpt2`: DistilGPT2 English language model pretrained with the supervision of `gpt2` (the smallest version of GPT2) on [OpenWebTextCorpus](https://skylion007.github.io/OpenWebTextCorpus/), a reproduction of OpenAI\\'s WebText dataset. The model has 6 layers, 768 dimension and 12 heads, totalizing 82M parameters (compared to 124M parameters for GPT2). On average, DistilGPT2 is two times faster than GPT2. - `distilroberta-base`: DistilRoBERTa English language model pretrained with the supervision of `roberta-base` solely on [OpenWebTextCorpus](https://skylion007.github.io/OpenWebTextCorpus/), a reproduction of OpenAI\\'s WebText dataset (it is ~4 times less training data than the teacher RoBERTa). The model has 6 layers, 768 dimension and 12 heads, totalizing 82M parameters (compared to 125M parameters for RoBERTa-base). On average DistilRoBERTa is twice as fast as Roberta-base. - `distilbert-base-multilingual-cased`: DistilmBERT multilingual model pretrained with the supervision of `bert-base-multilingual-cased` on the concatenation of Wikipedia in 104 different languages. The model supports the 104 languages listed [here](https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/multilingual.md#list-of-languages). The model has 6 layers, 768 dimension and 12 heads, totalizing 134M parameters (compared to 177M parameters for mBERT-base). On average DistilmBERT is twice as fast as mBERT-base. Using DistilBERT is very similar to using BERT. DistilBERT share the same tokenizer as BERT\\'s `bert-base-uncased` even though we provide a link to this tokenizer under the `DistilBertTokenizer` name to have a consistent naming between the library models. ```python\\ntokenizer = DistilBertTokenizer.from\\\\_pretrained(\\'distilbert-base-cased\\')\\nmodel = DistilBertModel.from\\\\_pretrained(\\'distilbert-base-cased\\')\\ninput\\\\_ids = torch.tensor(tokenizer.encode(\"Hello, my dog is cute\")).unsqueeze(0)\\noutputs = model(input\\\\_ids)\\nlast\\\\_hidden\\\\_states = outputs[0] # The last hidden-state is the first element of the output tuple\\n```\\nSimilarly, using the other Distil\\\\* models simply consists in calling the base classes with a different pretrained checkpoint:\\n- DistilBERT uncased: `model = DistilBertModel.from\\\\_pretrained(\\'distilbert-base-uncased\\')`\\n- DistilGPT2: `model = GPT2Model.from\\\\_pretrained(\\'distilgpt2\\')`\\n- DistilRoBERTa: `model = RobertaModel.from\\\\_pretrained(\\'distilroberta-base\\')`\\n- DistilmBERT: `model = DistilBertModel.from\\\\_pretrained(\\'distilbert-base-multilingual-cased\\')`\\n## How to train Distil\\\\*\\nIn the following, we will explain how you can train DistilBERT.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 17, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.99923795'}}, 'page_content': \"This is\\nalso a seeting where we only have `K=4` possible labels.

This introduction will guide you through setting up a working environment. If you're just starting the course, we recommend you first take a look at [Chapter 1](/course/chapter1), then come back and set up your environment so you can try the code yourself. All the libraries that we'll be using in this course are available as Python packages, so here we'll show you how to set up a Python environment and install the specific libraries you'll need. We'll cover two ways of setting up your working environment, using a Colab notebook or a Python virtual environment. Feel free to choose the one that resonates with you the most. For beginners, we strongly recommend that you get started by using a Colab notebook. Note that we will not be covering the Windows system. If you're running on Windows, we recommend following along using a Colab notebook. If you're using a Linux distribution or macOS, you can use either approach described here. Most of the course relies on you having a Hugging Face account. We recommend creating one now: [create an account](https://huggingface.co/join). ## Using a Google Colab notebook[[using-a-google-colab-notebook]]\\nUsing a Colab notebook is the simplest possible setup; boot up a notebook in your browser and get straight to coding! If you're not familiar with Colab, we recommend you start by following the [introduction](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb). Colab allows you to use some accelerating hardware, like GPUs or TPUs, and it is free for smaller workloads. Once you're comfortable moving around in Colab, create a new notebook and get started with the setup:\\n\\n![An empty colab notebook](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-course/documentation-images/resolve/main/en/chapter0/new_colab.png)\\n\\nThe next step is to install the libraries that we'll be using in this course. We'll use `pip` for the installation, which is the package manager for Python. In notebooks, you can run system commands by preceding them with the `!` character, so you can install the 🤗 Transformers library as follows:\\n```\\n!pip install transformers\\n```\\nYou can make sure the package was correctly installed by importing it within your Python runtime:\\n```\\nimport transformers\\n```\\n\\n![A gif showing the result of the two commands above: installation and import](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-course/documentation-images/resolve/main/en/chapter0/install.gif)\\n\\nThis installs a very light version of 🤗 Transformers. In particular, no specific machine learning frameworks (like PyTorch or TensorFlow) are installed. Since we'll be using a lot of different features of the library, we recommend installing the development version, which comes with all the required dependencies for pretty much any imaginable use case:\\n```\\n!pip install transformers[sentencepiece]\\n```\\nThis will take a bit of time, but then you'll be ready to go for the rest of the course!\", 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': '4de233a7-24d0-47c3-9de6-db2973ce164b', 'tool_call_id': 'call_ZTigpWfGt0YhYXR4ifAh7xAT', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 0, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.9991538'}}, 'page_content': '### What kinds of TPU are available?

It\\'s important to understand these concepts when developing your own component. Otherwise, your component may behave very different to other Gradio components! Tip: You can skip this section if you are familiar with the internals of the Gradio library, such as each component\\'s preprocess and postprocess methods. ## Interactive vs Static\\nEvery component in Gradio comes in a `static` variant, and most come in an `interactive` version as well. The `static` version is used when a component is displaying a value, and the user can \\\\*\\\\*NOT\\\\*\\\\* change that value by interacting with it. The `interactive` version is used when the user is able to change the value by interacting with the Gradio UI. Let\\'s see some examples:\\n```python\\nimport gradio as gr\\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\\ngr.Textbox(value=\"Hello\", interactive=True)\\ngr.Textbox(value=\"Hello\", interactive=False)\\ndemo.launch()\\n```\\nThis will display two textboxes. The only difference: you\\'ll be able to edit the value of the Gradio component on top, and you won\\'t be able to edit the variant on the bottom (i.e. the textbox will be disabled). Perhaps a more interesting example is with the `Image` component:\\n```python\\nimport gradio as gr\\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\\ngr.Image(interactive=True)\\ngr.Image(interactive=False)\\ndemo.launch()\\n```\\nThe interactive version of the component is much more complex -- you can upload images or snap a picture from your webcam -- while the static version can only be used to display images. Not every component has a distinct interactive version. For example, the `gr.AnnotatedImage` only appears as a static version since there\\'s no way to interactively change the value of the annotations or the image. ### What you need to remember\\n\\\\* Gradio will use the interactive version (if available) of a component if that component is used as the \\\\*\\\\*input\\\\*\\\\* to any event; otherwise, the static version will be used. \\\\* When you design custom components, you \\\\*\\\\*must\\\\*\\\\* accept the boolean interactive keyword in the constructor of your Python class. In the frontend, you \\\\*\\\\*may\\\\*\\\\* accept the `interactive` property, a `bool` which represents whether the component should be static or interactive. If you do not use this property in the frontend, the component will appear the same in interactive or static mode. ## The value and how it is preprocessed/postprocessed\\nThe most important attribute of a component is its `value`.\\n\\nNote: you can pass in a default value to the state parameter,\\nwhich is used as the initial value of the state. ### Using interpretation to understand predictions[[using-interpretation-to-understand-predictions]]\\nMost machine learning models are black boxes and the internal logic of the function is hidden from the end user. To encourage transparency, we\\'ve made it very easy to add interpretation to your model by simply setting the interpretation keyword in the Interface class to default. This allows your users to understand what parts of the input are responsible for the output. Take a look at the simple interface below which shows an image classifier that also includes interpretation:\\n```py\\nimport requests\\nimport tensorflow as tf\\nimport gradio as gr\\ninception\\\\_net = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2() # load the model\\n# Download human-readable labels for ImageNet. response = requests.get(\"https://git.io/JJkYN\")\\nlabels = response.text.split(\"\\\\n\")\\ndef classify\\\\_image(inp):\\ninp = inp.reshape((-1, 224, 224, 3))\\ninp = tf.keras.applications.mobilenet\\\\_v2.preprocess\\\\_input(inp)\\nprediction = inception\\\\_net.predict(inp).flatten()\\nreturn {labels[i]: float(prediction[i]) for i in range(1000)}\\nimage = gr.Image(shape=(224, 224))\\nlabel = gr.Label(num\\\\_top\\\\_classes=3)\\ntitle = \"Gradio Image Classifiction + Interpretation Example\"\\ngr.Interface(\\nfn=classify\\\\_image, inputs=image, outputs=label, interpretation=\"default\", title=title\\n).launch()\\n```\\nTest the interpretation function by submitting an input then clicking Interpret under the output component.\\n\\nBesides the default interpretation method Gradio provides, you can also specify `shap` for the `interpretation` parameter and set the `num\\\\_shap` parameter. This uses Shapley-based interpretation, which you can read more about [here](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/shap.html). Lastly, you can also pass in your own interpretation function into the `interpretation` parameter. See an example in Gradio\\'s getting started page [here](https://gradio.app/getting\\\\_started/). This wraps up our deep dive into the `Interface` class of Gradio. As we\\'ve seen, this class makes it simple to create machine learning demos in a few lines of Python code.

The configuration of a model is an object that\\nwill contain all the necessary information to build the model.

The inheritance is to make sure you get all the functionality from the 🤗 Transformers library, while the two other\\nconstraints come from the fact a `PretrainedConfig` has more fields than the ones you are setting. When reloading a\\nconfig with the `from\\\\_pretrained` method, those fields need to be accepted by your config and then sent to the\\nsuperclass. Defining a `model\\\\_type` for your configuration (here `model\\\\_type=\"resnet\"`) is not mandatory, unless you want to\\nregister your model with the auto classes (see last section). With this done, you can easily create and save your configuration like you would do with any other model config of the\\nlibrary. Here is how we can create a resnet50d config and save it:\\n```py\\nresnet50d\\\\_config = ResnetConfig(block\\\\_type=\"bottleneck\", stem\\\\_width=32, stem\\\\_type=\"deep\", avg\\\\_down=True)\\nresnet50d\\\\_config.save\\\\_pretrained(\"custom-resnet\")\\n```\\nThis will save a file named `config.json` inside the folder `custom-resnet`. You can then reload your config with the\\n`from\\\\_pretrained` method:\\n```py\\nresnet50d\\\\_config = ResnetConfig.from\\\\_pretrained(\"custom-resnet\")\\n```\\nYou can also use any other method of the [`PretrainedConfig`] class, like [`~PretrainedConfig.push\\\\_to\\\\_hub`] to\\ndirectly upload your config to the Hub. ## Writing a custom model\\nNow that we have our ResNet configuration, we can go on writing the model. We will actually write two: one that\\nextracts the hidden features from a batch of images (like [`BertModel`]) and one that is suitable for image\\nclassification (like [`BertForSequenceClassification`]). As we mentioned before, we\\'ll only write a loose wrapper of the model to keep it simple for this example. The only\\nthing we need to do before writing this class is a map between the block types and actual block classes. Then the\\nmodel is defined from the configuration by passing everything to the `ResNet` class:\\n```py\\nfrom transformers import PreTrainedModel\\nfrom timm.models.resnet import BasicBlock, Bottleneck, ResNet\\nfrom .configuration\\\\_resnet import ResnetConfig\\nBLOCK\\\\_MAPPING = {\"basic\": BasicBlock, \"bottleneck\": Bottleneck}\\nclass ResnetModel(PreTrainedModel):\\nconfig\\\\_class = ResnetConfig\\ndef \\\\_\\\\_init\\\\_\\\\_(self, config):\\nsuper().\\\\_\\\\_init\\\\_\\\\_(config)\\nblock\\\\_layer = BLOCK\\\\_MAPPING[config.block\\\\_type]\\nself.model = ResNet(\\nblock\\\\_layer,\\nconfig.layers,\\nnum\\\\_classes=config.num\\\\_classes,\\nin\\\\_chans=config.input\\\\_channels,\\ncardinality=config.cardinality,\\nbase\\\\_width=config.base\\\\_width,\\nstem\\\\_width=config.stem\\\\_width,\\nstem\\\\_type=config.stem\\\\_type,\\navg\\\\_down=config.avg\\\\_down,\\n)\\ndef forward(self, tensor):\\nreturn self.model.forward\\\\_features(tensor)\\n```\\nFor the model that will classify images, we just change the forward method:\\n```py\\nimport torch\\nclass ResnetModelForImageClassification(PreTrainedModel):\\nconfig\\\\_class = ResnetConfig\\ndef \\\\_\\\\_init\\\\_\\\\_(self, config):\\nsuper().\\\\_\\\\_init\\\\_\\\\_(config)\\nblock\\\\_layer = BLOCK\\\\_MAPPING[config.block\\\\_type]\\nself.model = ResNet(\\nblock\\\\_layer,\\nconfig.layers,\\nnum\\\\_classes=config.num\\\\_classes,\\nin\\\\_chans=config.input\\\\_channels,\\ncardinality=config.cardinality,\\nbase\\\\_width=config.base\\\\_width,\\nstem\\\\_width=config.stem\\\\_width,\\nstem\\\\_type=config.stem\\\\_type,\\navg\\\\_down=config.avg\\\\_down,\\n)\\ndef forward(self, tensor, labels=None):\\nlogits = self.model(tensor)\\nif labels is not None:\\nloss = torch.nn.cross\\\\_entropy(logits, labels)\\nreturn {\"loss\": loss, \"logits\": logits}\\nreturn {\"logits\": logits}\\n```\\nIn both cases, notice how we inherit from `PreTrainedModel` and call the superclass initialization with the `config`\\n(a bit like when you write a regular `torch.nn.Module`).\\n\\nYou can check the result\\nin this [model repo](https://huggingface.co/sgugger/custom-resnet50d). See the [sharing tutorial](model\\\\_sharing) for more information on the push to Hub method. ## Using a model with custom code\\nYou can use any configuration, model or tokenizer with custom code files in its repository with the auto-classes and\\nthe `from\\\\_pretrained` method. All files and code uploaded to the Hub are scanned for malware (refer to the [Hub security](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security#malware-scanning) documentation for more information), but you should still\\nreview the model code and author to avoid executing malicious code on your machine.

Note that \"locally\" and \"globally\" attending tokens are projected by different query, key and value matrices. Also note\\nthat every \"locally\" attending token not only attends to tokens within its window \\\\\\\\(w\\\\\\\\), but also to all \"globally\"\\nattending tokens so that global attention is \\\\*symmetric\\\\*. The user can define which tokens attend \"locally\" and which tokens attend \"globally\" by setting the tensor\\n`global\\\\_attention\\\\_mask` at run-time appropriately. All Longformer models employ the following logic for\\n`global\\\\_attention\\\\_mask`:\\n- 0: the token attends \"locally\",\\n- 1: the token attends \"globally\".

Using Longformer self attention, the memory and time complexity of the query-key matmul operation, which usually\\nrepresents the memory and time bottleneck, can be reduced from \\\\\\\\(\\\\mathcal{O}(n\\\\_s \\\\times n\\\\_s)\\\\\\\\) to\\n\\\\\\\\(\\\\mathcal{O}(n\\\\_s \\\\times w)\\\\\\\\), with \\\\\\\\(n\\\\_s\\\\\\\\) being the sequence length and \\\\\\\\(w\\\\\\\\) being the average window\\nsize.\\n\\nThis can adversely affect their ability to model long-range phenomena common in images, such as symmetry and occlusion, especially with a small number of layers.

The abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*Transformer-based models are unable to process long sequences due to their self-attention operation, which scales\\nquadratically with the sequence length. To address this limitation, we introduce the Longformer with an attention\\nmechanism that scales linearly with sequence length, making it easy to process documents of thousands of tokens or\\nlonger. Longformer\\'s attention mechanism is a drop-in replacement for the standard self-attention and combines a local\\nwindowed attention with a task motivated global attention. Following prior work on long-sequence transformers, we\\nevaluate Longformer on character-level language modeling and achieve state-of-the-art results on text8 and enwik8.', 'type': 'Document'}}], 'status': 'success'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'messages', 'AIMessage'], 'kwargs': {'content': 'The purpose of local attention in Longformer is to allow each token to attend to a limited context of tokens around it, specifically to its \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{2} w\\\\) previous tokens and \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{2} w\\\\) succeeding tokens, where \\\\(w\\\\) is the window length defined in `config.attention_window`. This mechanism helps to reduce the memory and time complexity of the self-attention operation from \\\\(\\\\mathcal{O}(n_s \\\\times n_s)\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\mathcal{O}(n_s \\\\times w)\\\\), making it more efficient for processing long sequences.

We won\\'t dive into the specifics here, but we\\'ll offer some further readings if you want to get a better understanding at what happens under the hood. So when should one use an encoder? Encoders can be used as standalone models in a wide variety of tasks. For example BERT, arguably the most famous transformer model, is a standalone encoder model and at the time of release, beat the state of the art in many sequence classification tasks, question answering tasks, and masked language modeling, to only cite a few. The idea is that encoders are very powerful at extracting vectors that carry meaningful information about a sequence. This vector can then be handled down the road by additional layers of neurons to make sense of them. Let\\'s take a look at some examples where encoders really shine. First of all, Masked Language Modeling, or MLM. It\\'s the task of predicting a hidden word in a sequence of words. Here, for example, we have hidden the word between \"My\" and \"is\". This is one of the objectives with which BERT was trained: it was trained to predict hidden words in a sequence. Encoders shine in this scenario in particular, as bidirectional information is crucial here. If we didn\\'t have the words on the right (is, Sylvain, and the dot), then there is very little chance that BERT would have been able to identify \"name\" as the correct word. The encoder needs to have a good understanding of the sequence in order to predict a masked word, as even if the text is grammatically correct, It does not necessarily make sense in the context of the sequence. As mentioned earlier, encoders are good at doing sequence classification. Sentiment analysis is an example of a sequence classification task. The model\\'s aim is to identify the sentiment of a sequence – it can range from giving a sequence a rating from one to five stars if doing review analysis, to giving a positive or negative rating to a sequence, which is what is shown here. For example here, given the two sequences, we use the model to compute a prediction and to classify the sequences among these two classes: positive and negative. While the two sequences are very similar, containing the same words, the meaning is different – and the encoder model is able to grasp that difference.\\n\\nText Summarization with Pretrained Encoders\\nThis folder contains part of the code necessary to reproduce the results on abstractive summarization from the article [Text Summarization with Pretrained Encoders](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08345.pdf) by [Yang Liu](https://nlp-yang.github.io/) and [Mirella Lapata](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/).

GPTQ is a post-training quantziation method to compress LLMs, like GPT. GPTQ compresses GPT (decoder) models by reducing the number of bits needed to store each weight in the model, from 32 bits down to just 3-4 bits. This means the model takes up much less memory and can run on less Hardware, e.g. Single GPU for 13B Llama2 models. GPTQ analyzes each layer of the model separately and approximates the weights to preserve the overall accuracy. If you want to learn more and how to use it, check out [Optimize open LLMs using GPTQ and Hugging Face Optimum](https://www.philschmid.de/gptq-llama). ## Benchmark\\nTo benchmark the real-world performance of Llama 2, we tested 3 model sizes (7B, 13B, 70B parameters) on four different instance types with four different load levels, resulting in 60 different configurations:\\n- Models: We evaluated all currently available model sizes, including 7B, 13B, and 70B.', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': 'e3486b83-a038-47d9-a729-6aef674abfa4', 'tool_call_id': 'call_ORMfbnUFfdbn08joOTxqVOkS', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 16, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.9993061'}}, 'page_content': 'More interestingly, the degradation is minimal! ## Conclusion and final words\\nIn this blogpost, we compared bitsandbytes and GPTQ quantization across multiple setups.

Falcon 180B typically sits somewhere between GPT 3.5 and GPT4 depending on the evaluation benchmark and further finetuning from the community will be very interesting to follow now that it\\'s openly released. ![Palm 2 comparison](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/162\\\\_falcon\\\\_180b/palm2\\\\_480.jpg)\\nWith 68.74 on the Hugging Face Leaderboard, Falcon 180B is the highest-scoring openly released pre-trained LLM, surpassing Meta’s LLaMA 2 (67.35). | Model | Size | Leaderboard score | Commercial use or license | Pretraining length |\\n| ------- | ---- | ----------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------ |\\n| Falcon | 180B | 68.74 | 🟠 | 3,500B |\\n| Llama 2 | 70B | 67.35 | 🟠 | 2,000B |\\n| LLaMA | 65B | 64.23 | 🔴 | 1,400B |\\n| Falcon | 40B | 61.48 | 🟢 | 1,000B |\\n| MPT | 30B | 56.15 | 🟢 | 1,000B |\\n![open\\\\_llm\\\\_leaderboard.png](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/162\\\\_falcon\\\\_180b/open\\\\_llm\\\\_leaderboard.jpg)\\nThe quantized Falcon models preserve similar metrics across benchmarks.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 19, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.99875665'}}, 'page_content': 'If you want to learn more about Llama 2 check out this [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/llama2). ### What is GPTQ? GPTQ is a post-training quantziation method to compress LLMs, like GPT. GPTQ compresses GPT (decoder) models by reducing the number of bits needed to store each weight in the model, from 32 bits down to just 3-4 bits. This means the model takes up much less memory and can run on less Hardware, e.g. Single GPU for 13B Llama2 models. GPTQ analyzes each layer of the model separately and approximates the weights to preserve the overall accuracy. If you want to learn more and how to use it, check out [Optimize open LLMs using GPTQ and Hugging Face Optimum](https://www.philschmid.de/gptq-llama). ## Benchmark\\nTo benchmark the real-world performance of Llama 2, we tested 3 model sizes (7B, 13B, 70B parameters) on four different instance types with four different load levels, resulting in 60 different configurations:\\n- Models: We evaluated all currently available model sizes, including 7B, 13B, and 70B.', 'type': 'Document'}}], 'status': 'success'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'messages', 'AIMessage'], 'kwargs': {'content': \"The license for TheBloke/Chronohermes-Grad-L2-13B-GPTQ can be found on its Hugging Face model page.

Causal Language Modeling is the task of predicting the next token based on the previous token. Another term for Causal Language Modeling is Autoregressive Modeling. In the example that you see here the next token could for example be NLP or machine learning. A popular example of a Causal Language Model is the GPT family of models. To train such models such as GPT-2 we usually start with a large corpus of text files. These files can webpages scraped from the internet such as the Common Crawl dataset or they can be Python files from GitHub like you can see here. As a first step we need to tokenize these files such that we can feed them through a model. Here we show the tokenized texts as bars of various length illustrating the different sequence lengths. Normally, the text files come in various sizes and which results in various sequence length of the tokenized texts. Transformer models have a limited context length and depending on the data source it is possible that the tokenized texts are much longer than this context length. In this case we could just truncate the sequence to the context length but this would mean that we loose everything after the context length. Using the return overflowing tokens flag in the we can use the tokenizer to create chunks with each one being the size of the context length. Sometimes it can happen that the last chunk is too short if there aren’t enough tokens to fill it. In this case we would like to remove it. With the return\\\\_length keyword we also get the length of each chunk from the tokenizer. This function shows all the steps necessary to prepare the dataset. First we tokenize the dataset with the flags I just mentioned. Then we go through each chunk and if its length matches the context length we add it to the inputs we return. We can apply this function to the whole dataset and we make sure to use batches and remove the existing columns.

In order to handle a repository, you should first have a Hugging Face account. A link to create a new account is available in the description. Once you are logged in, you can create a new repository by clicking on the \"New model\" option. You should be facing a similar modal to the following. In the \"Owner\" input, you can put either your own namespace or any of your organisations namespaces. The model name is the model identifier that will then be used to identify your model on your chosen namespace. The final choice is between public and private. Public models are accessible by anyone. This is the recommended, free option, as this makes your model easily accessible and shareable. The owners of your namespace are the only ones who can update and change your model. A more advanced option is the private option. In this case, only the owners of your namespace will have visibility over your model. Other users won\\'t know it exists and will not be able to use it. Let\\'s create a dummy model to play with. Once your model is created, comes the management of that model! Three tabs are available to you. You\\'re facing the first one, which is the model card page; this is the page used to showcase your model to the world.\\n\\n!--⚠️ Note that this file is in Markdown but contain specific syntax for our doc-builder (similar to MDX) that may not be\\nrendered properly in your Markdown viewer. -->\\n# Manage `huggingface\\\\_hub` cache-system\\n## Understand caching\\nThe Hugging Face Hub cache-system is designed to be the central cache shared across libraries\\nthat depend on the Hub. It has been updated in v0.8.0 to prevent re-downloading same files\\nbetween revisions. The caching system is designed as follows:\\n```\\n├─ \\n├─ \\n├─ \\n```\\nThe `` is usually your user\\'s home directory. However, it is customizable with the `cache\\\\_dir` argument on all methods, or by specifying either `HF\\\\_HOME` or `HF\\\\_HUB\\\\_CACHE` environment variable. Models, datasets and spaces share a common root. Each of these repositories contains the\\nrepository type, the namespace (organization or username) if it exists and the\\nrepository name:\\n```\\n├─ models--julien-c--EsperBERTo-small\\n├─ models--lysandrejik--arxiv-nlp\\n├─ models--bert-base-cased\\n├─ datasets--glue\\n├─ datasets--huggingface--DataMeasurementsFiles\\n├─ spaces--dalle-mini--dalle-mini\\n```\\nIt is within these folders that all files will now be downloaded from the Hub. Caching ensures that\\na file isn\\'t downloaded twice if it already exists and wasn\\'t updated; but if it was updated,\\nand you\\'re asking for the latest file, then it will download the latest file (while keeping\\nthe previous file intact in case you need it again). In order to achieve this, all folders contain the same skeleton:\\n```\\n├─ datasets--glue\\n│ ├─ refs\\n│ ├─ blobs\\n│ ├─ snapshots\\n... ```\\nEach folder is designed to contain the following:\\n### Refs\\nThe `refs` folder contains files which indicates the latest revision of the given reference. For example,\\nif we have previously fetched a file from the `main` branch of a repository, the `refs`\\nfolder will contain a file named `main`, which will itself contain the commit identifier of the current head. If the latest commit of `main` has `aaaaaa` as identifier, then it will contain `aaaaaa`. If that same branch gets updated with a new commit, that has `bbbbbb` as an identifier, then\\nre-downloading a file from that reference will update the `refs/main` file to contain `bbbbbb`. ### Blobs\\nThe `blobs` folder contains the actual files that we have downloaded. The name of each file is their hash. ### Snapshots\\nThe `snapshots` folder contains symlinks to the blobs mentioned above. It is itself made up of several folders:\\none per known revision! In the explanation above, we had initially fetched a file from the `aaaaaa` revision, before fetching a file from\\nthe `bbbbbb` revision. In this situation, we would now have two folders in the `snapshots` folder: `aaaaaa`\\nand `bbbbbb`. In each of these folders, live symlinks that have the names of the files that we have downloaded. For example,\\nif we had downloaded the `README.md` file at revision `aaaaaa`, we would have the following path:\\n```\\n//snapshots/aaaaaa/README.md\\n```\\nThat `README.md` file is actually a symlink linking to the blob that has the hash of the file. By creating the skeleton this way we open the mechanism to file sharing: if the same file was fetched in\\nrevision `bbbbbb`, it would have the same hash and the file would not need to be re-downloaded. ### .no\\\\_exist (advanced)\\nIn addition to the `blobs`, `refs` and `snapshots` folders, you might also find a `.no\\\\_exist` folder\\nin your cache. This folder keeps track of files that you\\'ve tried to download once but don\\'t exist\\non the Hub. Its structure is the same as the `snapshots` folder with 1 subfolder per known revision:\\n```\\n//.no\\\\_exist/aaaaaa/config\\\\_that\\\\_does\\\\_not\\\\_exist.json\\n```\\nUnlike the `snapshots` folder, files are simple empty files (no symlinks). In this example,\\nthe file `\"config\\\\_that\\\\_does\\\\_not\\\\_exist.json\"` does not exist on the Hub for the revision `\"aaaaaa\"`. As it only stores empty files, this folder is neglectable is term of disk usage. So now you might wonder, why is this information even relevant? In some cases, a framework tries to load optional files for a model. Saving the non-existence\\nof optional files makes it faster to load a model as it saves 1 HTTP call per possible optional file. This is for example the case in `transformers` where each tokenizer can support additional files.

Counting the number of downloads for models is not a trivial task as a single model repository might contain multiple files, including multiple model weight files (e.g., with sharded models), and different formats depending on the library. To avoid double counting downloads (e.g., counting a single download of a model as multiple downloads), the Hub uses a set of query files that are employed for download counting. No information is sent from the user, and no additional calls are made for this. The count is done server-side as we serve files for downloads. Every HTTP request to these files, including `GET` and `HEAD` will be counted as a download. By default, when no library is specified, the Hub uses `config.json` as the default query file. Otherwise, the query file depends on each library, and the Hub might examine files such as `pytorch\\\\_model.bin` and `adapter\\\\_config.json`. ## Which are the query files for different libraries? By default, the Hub looks at `config.json`, `config.yaml`, `hyperparams.yaml`, and `meta.yaml`. For the following set of libraries, there are specific query files\\n```json\\n{\\n\"adapter-transformers\": {\\nfilter: [\\n{\\nterm: { path: \"adapter\\\\_config.json\" },\\n},\\n],\\n},\\n\"asteroid\": {\\nfilter: [\\n{\\nterm: { path: \"pytorch\\\\_model.bin\" },\\n},\\n],\\n},\\n\"flair\": {\\nfilter: [\\n{\\nterm: { path: \"pytorch\\\\_model.bin\" },\\n},\\n],\\n},\\n\"keras\": {\\nfilter: [\\n{\\nterm: { path: \"saved\\\\_model.pb\" },\\n},\\n],\\n},\\n\"ml-agents\": {\\nfilter: [\\n{\\nwildcard: { path: \"\\\\*.onnx\" },\\n},\\n],\\n},\\n\"nemo\": {\\nfilter: [\\n{\\nwildcard: { path: \"\\\\*.nemo\" },\\n},\\n],\\n},\\n\"open\\\\_clip\": {\\nfilter: [\\n{\\nwildcard: { path: \"\\\\*pytorch\\\\_model.bin\" },\\n},\\n],\\n},\\n\"sample-factory\": {\\nfilter: [\\n{\\nterm: { path: \"cfg.json\" },\\n},\\n],\\n},\\n\"paddlenlp\": {\\nfilter: [\\n{\\nterm: { path: \"model\\\\_config.json\" },\\n},\\n],\\n},\\n\"speechbrain\": {\\nfilter: [\\n{\\nterm: { path: \"hyperparams.yaml\" },\\n},\\n],\\n},\\n\"sklearn\": {\\nfilter: [\\n{\\nterm: { path: \"sklearn\\\\_model.joblib\" },\\n},\\n],\\n},\\n\"spacy\": {\\nfilter: [\\n{\\nwildcard: { path: \"\\\\*.whl\" },\\n},\\n],\\n},\\n\"stanza\": {\\nfilter: [\\n{\\nterm: { path: \"models/default.zip\" },\\n},\\n],\\n},\\n\"stable-baselines3\": {\\nfilter: [\\n{\\nwildcard: { path: \"\\\\*.zip\" },\\n},\\n],\\n},\\n\"timm\": {\\nfilter: [\\n{\\nterms: { path: [\"pytorch\\\\_model.bin\", \"model.safetensors\"] },\\n},\\n],\\n},\\n\"diffusers\": {\\n/// Filter out nested safetensors and pickle weights to avoid double counting downloads from the diffusers lib\\nmust\\\\_not: [\\n{\\nwildcard: { path: \"\\\\*/\\\\*.safetensors\" },\\n},\\n{\\nwildcard: { path: \"\\\\*/\\\\*.bin\" },\\n},\\n],\\n/// Include documents that match at least one of the following rules\\nshould: [\\n/// Downloaded from diffusers lib\\n{\\nterm: { path: \"model\\\\_index.json\" },\\n},\\n/// Direct downloads (LoRa, Auto1111 and others)\\n{\\nwildcard: { path: \"\\\\*.safetensors\" },\\n},\\n{\\nwildcard: { path: \"\\\\*.ckpt\" },\\n},\\n{\\nwildcard: { path: \"\\\\*.bin\" },\\n},\\n],\\nminimum\\\\_should\\\\_match: 1,\\n},\\n\"peft\": {\\nfilter: [\\n{\\nterm: { path: \"adapter\\\\_config.json\" },\\n},\\n],\\n}\\n}\\n```', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': 'b4a060d5-cd2b-4358-a0ed-01bcc8b409ec', 'tool_call_id': 'call_M6qiPBc9Ojx3IKcC5o6O6OFX', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 18, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.99932706'}}, 'page_content': 'n this video, we\\'re going to understand how to manage a model repository on the HuggingFace model hub. In order to handle a repository, you should first have a Hugging Face account. A link to create a new account is available in the description. Once you are logged in, you can create a new repository by clicking on the \"New model\" option. You should be facing a similar modal to the following. In the \"Owner\" input, you can put either your own namespace or any of your organisations namespaces. The model name is the model identifier that will then be used to identify your model on your chosen namespace. The final choice is between public and private. Public models are accessible by anyone. This is the recommended, free option, as this makes your model easily accessible and shareable. The owners of your namespace are the only ones who can update and change your model. A more advanced option is the private option. In this case, only the owners of your namespace will have visibility over your model. Other users won\\'t know it exists and will not be able to use it. Let\\'s create a dummy model to play with. Once your model is created, comes the management of that model! Three tabs are available to you.

It has been updated in v0.8.0 to prevent re-downloading same files\\nbetween revisions. The caching system is designed as follows:\\n```\\n├─ \\n├─ \\n├─ \\n```\\nThe `` is usually your user\\'s home directory. However, it is customizable with the `cache\\\\_dir` argument on all methods, or by specifying either `HF\\\\_HOME` or `HF\\\\_HUB\\\\_CACHE` environment variable. Models, datasets and spaces share a common root. Each of these repositories contains the\\nrepository type, the namespace (organization or username) if it exists and the\\nrepository name:\\n```\\n├─ models--julien-c--EsperBERTo-small\\n├─ models--lysandrejik--arxiv-nlp\\n├─ models--bert-base-cased\\n├─ datasets--glue\\n├─ datasets--huggingface--DataMeasurementsFiles\\n├─ spaces--dalle-mini--dalle-mini\\n```\\nIt is within these folders that all files will now be downloaded from the Hub. Caching ensures that\\na file isn\\'t downloaded twice if it already exists and wasn\\'t updated; but if it was updated,\\nand you\\'re asking for the latest file, then it will download the latest file (while keeping\\nthe previous file intact in case you need it again). In order to achieve this, all folders contain the same skeleton:\\n```\\n├─ datasets--glue\\n│ ├─ refs\\n│ ├─ blobs\\n│ ├─ snapshots\\n... ```\\nEach folder is designed to contain the following:\\n### Refs\\nThe `refs` folder contains files which indicates the latest revision of the given reference. For example,\\nif we have previously fetched a file from the `main` branch of a repository, the `refs`\\nfolder will contain a file named `main`, which will itself contain the commit identifier of the current head. If the latest commit of `main` has `aaaaaa` as identifier, then it will contain `aaaaaa`. If that same branch gets updated with a new commit, that has `bbbbbb` as an identifier, then\\nre-downloading a file from that reference will update the `refs/main` file to contain `bbbbbb`. ### Blobs\\nThe `blobs` folder contains the actual files that we have downloaded. The name of each file is their hash. ### Snapshots\\nThe `snapshots` folder contains symlinks to the blobs mentioned above. It is itself made up of several folders:\\none per known revision! In the explanation above, we had initially fetched a file from the `aaaaaa` revision, before fetching a file from\\nthe `bbbbbb` revision. In this situation, we would now have two folders in the `snapshots` folder: `aaaaaa`\\nand `bbbbbb`. In each of these folders, live symlinks that have the names of the files that we have downloaded. For example,\\nif we had downloaded the `README.md` file at revision `aaaaaa`, we would have the following path:\\n```\\n//snapshots/aaaaaa/README.md\\n```\\nThat `README.md` file is actually a symlink linking to the blob that has the hash of the file. By creating the skeleton this way we open the mechanism to file sharing: if the same file was fetched in\\nrevision `bbbbbb`, it would have the same hash and the file would not need to be re-downloaded. ### .no\\\\_exist (advanced)\\nIn addition to the `blobs`, `refs` and `snapshots` folders, you might also find a `.no\\\\_exist` folder\\nin your cache. This folder keeps track of files that you\\'ve tried to download once but don\\'t exist\\non the Hub. Its structure is the same as the `snapshots` folder with 1 subfolder per known revision:\\n```\\n//.no\\\\_exist/aaaaaa/config\\\\_that\\\\_does\\\\_not\\\\_exist.json\\n```\\nUnlike the `snapshots` folder, files are simple empty files (no symlinks). In this example,\\nthe file `\"config\\\\_that\\\\_does\\\\_not\\\\_exist.json\"` does not exist on the Hub for the revision `\"aaaaaa\"`. As it only stores empty files, this folder is neglectable is term of disk usage. So now you might wonder, why is this information even relevant? In some cases, a framework tries to load optional files for a model. Saving the non-existence\\nof optional files makes it faster to load a model as it saves 1 HTTP call per possible optional file. This is for example the case in `transformers` where each tokenizer can support additional files. The first time you load the tokenizer on your machine, it will cache which optional files exists (and\\nwhich doesn\\'t) to make the loading time faster for the next initializations. To test if a file is cached locally (without making any HTTP request), you can use the [`try\\\\_to\\\\_load\\\\_from\\\\_cache`]\\nhelper. It will either return the filepath (if exists and cached), the object `\\\\_CACHED\\\\_NO\\\\_EXIST` (if non-existence\\nis cached) or `None` (if we don\\'t know). ```python\\nfrom huggingface\\\\_hub import try\\\\_to\\\\_load\\\\_from\\\\_cache, \\\\_CACHED\\\\_NO\\\\_EXIST\\nfilepath = try\\\\_to\\\\_load\\\\_from\\\\_cache()\\nif isinstance(filepath, str):\\n# file exists and is cached\\n... elif filepath is \\\\_CACHED\\\\_NO\\\\_EXIST:\\n# non-existence of file is cached\\n... else:\\n# file is not cached\\n... ```\\n### In practice\\nIn practice, your cache should look like the following tree:\\n```text\\n[ 96] . └── [ 160] models--julien-c--EsperBERTo-small\\n├── [ 160] blobs\\n│ ├── [321M] 403450e234d65943a7dcf7e05a771ce3c92faa84dd07db4ac20f592037a1e4bd\\n│ ├── [ 398] 7cb18dc9bafbfcf74629a4b760af1b160957a83e\\n│ └── [1.4K] d7edf6bd2a681fb0175f7735299831ee1b22b812\\n├── [ 96] refs\\n│ └── [ 40] main\\n└── [ 128] snapshots\\n├── [ 128] 2439f60ef33a0d46d85da5001d52aeda5b00ce9f\\n│ ├── [ 52] README.md -> ../../blobs/d7edf6bd2a681fb0175f7735299831ee1b22b812\\n│ └── [ 76] pytorch\\\\_model.bin -> ../../blobs/403450e234d65943a7dcf7e05a771ce3c92faa84dd07db4ac20f592037a1e4bd\\n└── [ 128] bbc77c8132af1cc5cf678da3f1ddf2de43606d48\\n├── [ 52] README.md -> ../../blobs/7cb18dc9bafbfcf74629a4b760af1b160957a83e\\n└── [ 76] pytorch\\\\_model.bin -> ../../blobs/403450e234d65943a7dcf7e05a771ce3c92faa84dd07db4ac20f592037a1e4bd\\n```\\n### Limitations\\nIn order to have an efficient cache-system, `huggingface-hub` uses symlinks.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 5, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.9990542'}}, 'page_content': 'Models Download Stats\\n## How are download stats generated for models?

It is a Graph Transformer model, modified to allow computations on graphs instead of text sequences by generating embeddings and features of interest during preprocessing and collation, then using a modified attention. The abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*The Transformer architecture has become a dominant choice in many domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision. Yet, it has not achieved competitive performance on popular leaderboards of graph-level prediction compared to mainstream GNN variants. Therefore, it remains a mystery how Transformers could perform well for graph representation learning. In this paper, we solve this mystery by presenting Graphormer, which is built upon the standard Transformer architecture, and could attain excellent results on a broad range of graph representation learning tasks, especially on the recent OGB Large-Scale Challenge. Our key insight to utilizing Transformer in the graph is the necessity of effectively encoding the structural information of a graph into the model. To this end, we propose several simple yet effective structural encoding methods to help Graphormer better model graph-structured data. Besides, we mathematically characterize the expressive power of Graphormer and exhibit that with our ways of encoding the structural information of graphs, many popular GNN variants could be covered as the special cases of Graphormer.\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [clefourrier](https://huggingface.co/clefourrier). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/Graphormer). ## Usage tips\\nThis model will not work well on large graphs (more than 100 nodes/edges), as it will make the memory explode.

It is a Graph Transformer model, modified to allow computations on graphs instead of text sequences by generating embeddings and features of interest during preprocessing and collation, then using a modified attention. The abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\\\*The Transformer architecture has become a dominant choice in many domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision. Yet, it has not achieved competitive performance on popular leaderboards of graph-level prediction compared to mainstream GNN variants. Therefore, it remains a mystery how Transformers could perform well for graph representation learning. In this paper, we solve this mystery by presenting Graphormer, which is built upon the standard Transformer architecture, and could attain excellent results on a broad range of graph representation learning tasks, especially on the recent OGB Large-Scale Challenge. Our key insight to utilizing Transformer in the graph is the necessity of effectively encoding the structural information of a graph into the model. To this end, we propose several simple yet effective structural encoding methods to help Graphormer better model graph-structured data. Besides, we mathematically characterize the expressive power of Graphormer and exhibit that with our ways of encoding the structural information of graphs, many popular GNN variants could be covered as the special cases of Graphormer.\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [clefourrier](https://huggingface.co/clefourrier). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/Graphormer). ## Usage tips\\nThis model will not work well on large graphs (more than 100 nodes/edges), as it will make the memory explode. You can reduce the batch size, increase your RAM, or decrease the `UNREACHABLE\\\\_NODE\\\\_DISTANCE` parameter in algos\\\\_graphormer.pyx, but it will be hard to go above 700 nodes/edges.

This also explains why we reported latencies only for these two frameworks. ## Automatic Performances Tuning: Bayesian Optimization with Intel SigOpt\\nAs mentioned above, many knobs can be tweaked to improve latency and throughput on Intel CPUs, but because there are many, tuning all of them to get optimal performance can be cumbersome. For instance, in our experiments, the following knobs were tuned:\\n- The number of cores: although using as many cores as you have is often a good idea, it does not always provide the best performance because it also means more communication between the different threads. On top of that, having better performance with fewer cores can be very useful as it allows to run multiple instances at the same time, resulting in both better latency and throughput. - The memory allocator: which memory allocator out of the default malloc, Google's tcmalloc and Facebook's jemalloc provides the best performance? - The parallelism library: which parallelism library out of GNU OpenMP and Intel OpenMP provides the best performance? - Transparent Huge Pages: does enabling Transparent Huge Pages (THP) on the system provide better performance? - KMP block time parameter: sets the time, in milliseconds, that a thread should wait, after completing the execution of a parallel region, before sleeping. Of course, the brute force approach, consisting of trying out all the possibilities will provide the best knob values to use to get optimal performance but,\\nthe size of the search space being `N x 3 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 24N`, it can take a lot of time: on a machine with 80 physical cores, this means trying out at most `24 x 80 = 1920` different setups! 😱\\nFortunately, Intel's [SigOpt](https://sigopt.com/), through Bayesian optimization, allows us to make these tuning experiments both faster and more convenient to analyse, while providing similar performance than the brute force approach. When we analyse the relative difference between the absolute best latency and what SigOpt provides, we observe that although it is often not as good as brute force (except for sequence length = 512 in that specific case),\\nit gives very close performance, with \\\\*\\\\*8.6%\\\\*\\\\* being the biggest gap on this figure. |  |  |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Figure 23.

We are actively expanding support to include other text generation model architectures and tasks, all from within Hugging Face.

Instead of hoping each few stacked layers directly fit a desired underlying mapping, residual nets let these layers fit a residual mapping. They stack [residual blocks](https://paperswithcode.com/method/residual-block) ontop of each other to form network: e.g. a ResNet-50 has fifty layers using these blocks. The models in this collection utilise semi-weakly supervised learning to improve the performance of the model. The approach brings important gains to standard architectures for image, video and fine-grained classification.

The abstract from the paper is:\\n\\\\*Diffusion models have significantly advanced the fields of image, audio, and video generation, but they depend on an iterative sampling process that causes slow generation. To overcome this limitation, we propose consistency models, a new family of models that generate high quality samples by directly mapping noise to data. They support fast one-step generation by design, while still allowing multistep sampling to trade compute for sample quality. They also support zero-shot data editing, such as image inpainting, colorization, and super-resolution, without requiring explicit training on these tasks. Consistency models can be trained either by distilling pre-trained diffusion models, or as standalone generative models altogether. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that they outperform existing distillation techniques for diffusion models in one- and few-step sampling, achieving the new state-of-the-art FID of 3.55 on CIFAR-10 and 6.20 on ImageNet 64x64 for one-step generation.

And then at run-time when the full layer params are needed just for the given layer, all GPUs synchronize to give each other parts that they miss - this is it. This component is implemented by DeepSpeed. ## Tensor Parallelism\\nIn Tensor Parallelism (TP) each GPU processes only a slice of a tensor and only aggregates the full tensor for operations that require the whole thing. In this section we use concepts and diagrams from the [Megatron-LM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM) paper: [Efficient Large-Scale Language Model Training on GPU Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04473). The main building block of any transformer is a fully connected `nn.Linear` followed by a nonlinear activation `GeLU`. Following the Megatron paper\\'s notation, we can write the dot-product part of it as `Y = GeLU(XA)`, where `X` and `Y` are the input and output vectors, and `A` is the weight matrix. If we look at the computation in matrix form, it\\'s easy to see how the matrix multiplication can be split between multiple GPUs:\\n![Parallel GEMM](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/parallelism-tp-parallel\\\\_gemm.png)\\nIf we split the weight matrix `A` column-wise across `N` GPUs and perform matrix multiplications `XA\\\\_1` through `XA\\\\_n` in parallel, then we will end up with `N` output vectors `Y\\\\_1, Y\\\\_2, ..., Y\\\\_n` which can be fed into `GeLU` independently:\\n![independent GeLU](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/parallelism-tp-independent-gelu.png). Notice with the Y matrix split along the columns, we can split the second GEMM along its rows so that it takes the output of the GeLU directly without any extra communication. Using this principle, we can update an MLP of arbitrary depth, while synchronizing the GPUs after each row-column sequence. The Megatron-LM paper authors provide a helpful illustration for that:\\n![parallel shard processing](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/parallelism-tp-parallel\\\\_shard\\\\_processing.png)\\nHere `f` is an identity operator in the forward pass and all reduce in the backward pass while `g` is an all reduce in the forward pass and identity in the backward pass. Parallelizing the multi-headed attention layers is even simpler, since they are already inherently parallel, due to having multiple independent heads! ![parallel self-attention](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/parallelism-tp-parallel\\\\_self\\\\_attention.png)\\nSpecial considerations: Due to the two all reduces per layer in both the forward and backward passes, TP requires a very fast interconnect between devices.\\n\\nThis vector is treated as the first embedding in self-attention to bring extraneous attention to the generated tokens. In the pre-trained model published from `Tanrei/GPTSAN-japanese`, the Spout Vector is a 128-dimensional vector that passes through 8 fully connected layers in the model and is projected into the space acting as external attention. The Spout Vector projected by the fully connected layer is split to be passed to all self-attentions. ## GPTSanJapaneseConfig\\n[[autodoc]] GPTSanJapaneseConfig\\n## GPTSanJapaneseTokenizer\\n[[autodoc]] GPTSanJapaneseTokenizer\\n## GPTSanJapaneseModel\\n[[autodoc]] GPTSanJapaneseModel\\n## GPTSanJapaneseForConditionalGeneration\\n[[autodoc]] GPTSanJapaneseForConditionalGeneration\\n- forward\\n\\n!--Copyright 2023 The HuggingFace Team.

GPTSAN is a Japanese language model using Switch Transformer. It has the same structure as the model introduced as Prefix LM\\nin the T5 paper, and support both Text Generation and Masked Language Modeling tasks.

This component is implemented by DeepSpeed. ## Tensor Parallelism\\nIn Tensor Parallelism (TP) each GPU processes only a slice of a tensor and only aggregates the full tensor for operations that require the whole thing. In this section we use concepts and diagrams from the [Megatron-LM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM) paper: [Efficient Large-Scale Language Model Training on GPU Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04473). The main building block of any transformer is a fully connected `nn.Linear` followed by a nonlinear activation `GeLU`. Following the Megatron paper's notation, we can write the dot-product part of it as `Y = GeLU(XA)`, where `X` and `Y` are the input and output vectors, and `A` is the weight matrix. If we look at the computation in matrix form, it's easy to see how the matrix multiplication can be split between multiple GPUs:\\n![Parallel GEMM](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/parallelism-tp-parallel\\\\_gemm.png)\\nIf we split the weight matrix `A` column-wise across `N` GPUs and perform matrix multiplications `XA\\\\_1` through `XA\\\\_n` in parallel, then we will end up with `N` output vectors `Y\\\\_1, Y\\\\_2, ..., Y\\\\_n` which can be fed into `GeLU` independently:\\n![independent GeLU](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/parallelism-tp-independent-gelu.png). Notice with the Y matrix split along the columns, we can split the second GEMM along its rows so that it takes the output of the GeLU directly without any extra communication. Using this principle, we can update an MLP of arbitrary depth, while synchronizing the GPUs after each row-column sequence. The Megatron-LM paper authors provide a helpful illustration for that:\\n![parallel shard processing](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/parallelism-tp-parallel\\\\_shard\\\\_processing.png)\\nHere `f` is an identity operator in the forward pass and all reduce in the backward pass while `g` is an all reduce in the forward pass and identity in the backward pass. Parallelizing the multi-headed attention layers is even simpler, since they are already inherently parallel, due to having multiple independent heads! ![parallel self-attention](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/parallelism-tp-parallel\\\\_self\\\\_attention.png)\\nSpecial considerations: Due to the two all reduces per layer in both the forward and backward passes, TP requires a very fast interconnect between devices.\", 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 12, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.99762017'}}, 'page_content': 'This vector is treated as the first embedding in self-attention to bring extraneous attention to the generated tokens.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on scaling up MobileNets and ResNet. To go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves state-of-the-art 84.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet.

Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on scaling up MobileNets and ResNet. To go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves state-of-the-art 84.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet. Our EfficientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7%), Flowers (98.8%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.\\\\*\\nThis model was contributed by [adirik](https://huggingface.co/adirik).

Introduction:\\nNatural language generation (i.e. text generation) is one of the core tasks in natural language processing (NLP). In this blog, we introduce the current state-of-the-art decoding method, \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_Contrastive Search\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_, for neural text generation. Contrastive search is originally proposed in \\\\_\"A Contrastive Framework for Neural Text Generation\"\\\\_ [[1]](#references) ([[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06417)[[Official Implementation]](https://github.com/yxuansu/SimCTG)) at NeurIPS 2022. Moreover, in this follow-up work, \\\\_\"Contrastive Search Is What You Need For Neural Text Generation\"\\\\_ [[2]](#references) ([[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14140) [[Official Implementation]](https://github.com/yxuansu/Contrastive\\\\_Search\\\\_Is\\\\_What\\\\_You\\\\_Need)), the authors further demonstrate that contrastive search can generate human-level text using \\\\*\\\\*off-the-shelf\\\\*\\\\* language models across \\\\*\\\\*16\\\\*\\\\* languages.\\n\\nset the probability of undesirable words or sequences to 0).

At the moment, you have three main avenues you can explore to get the most out of text generation, all tackling the performance of the model forward pass. First, you have the hardware-specific model optimizations. For instance, your device may be compatible with [Flash Attention](https://github.com/HazyResearch/flash-attention), which speeds up the attention layer through a reorder of the operations, or [INT8 quantization](https://huggingface.co/blog/hf-bitsandbytes-integration), which reduces the size of the model weights. Second, when you know you’ll get concurrent text generation requests, you can batch the inputs and massively increase the throughput with a small latency penalty. The model layer weights loaded into the device are now used on several input rows in parallel, which means that you’ll get more tokens out for approximately the same memory bandwidth burden. The catch with batching is that you need additional device memory (or to offload the memory somewhere) – at the end of this spectrum, you can see projects like [FlexGen](https://github.com/FMInference/FlexGen) which optimize throughput at the expense of latency. ```python\\n# Example showcasing the impact of batched generation.

However, that does not prevent you from querying the assistant again, after correcting the wrong token with your model, and repeating this process iteratively.

To save and store your model weights in the more secure `safetensor` format, we recommend converting your weights to `.safetensors`. The easiest way to convert your model weights is to use the [Convert Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/diffusers/convert), given your model weights are already stored on the Hub. The Convert Space downloads the pickled weights, converts them, and opens a Pull Request to upload the newly converted `.safetensors` file to your repository. For larger models, the Space may be a bit slower because its resources are tied up in converting other models. You can also try running the [convert.py](https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors/blob/main/bindings/python/convert.py) script (this is what the Space is running) locally to convert your weights. Feel free to ping [@Narsil](https://huggingface.co/Narsil) for any issues with the Space.\\n\\nYou can train a model in PyTorch and then export it to TorchScript to free the model from Python performance constraints. PyTorch [traces](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.jit.trace.html) a model to return a [`ScriptFunction`] that is optimized with just-in-time compilation (JIT). Compared to the default eager mode, JIT mode in PyTorch typically yields better performance for inference using optimization techniques like operator fusion. For a gentle introduction to TorchScript, see the [Introduction to PyTorch TorchScript](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/Intro\\\\_to\\\\_TorchScript\\\\_tutorial.html) tutorial. With the [`Trainer`] class, you can enable JIT mode for CPU inference by setting the `--jit\\\\_mode\\\\_eval` flag:\\n```bash\\npython run\\\\_qa.py \\\\\\n--model\\\\_name\\\\_or\\\\_path csarron/bert-base-uncased-squad-v1 \\\\\\n--dataset\\\\_name squad \\\\\\n--do\\\\_eval \\\\\\n--max\\\\_seq\\\\_length 384 \\\\\\n--doc\\\\_stride 128 \\\\\\n--output\\\\_dir /tmp/ \\\\\\n--no\\\\_cuda \\\\\\n--jit\\\\_mode\\\\_eval\\n```\\nFor PyTorch >= 1.14.0, JIT-mode could benefit any model for prediction and evaluaion since the dict input is supported in `jit.trace`. For PyTorch < 1.14.0, JIT-mode could benefit a model if its forward parameter order matches the tuple input order in `jit.trace`, such as a question-answering model. If the forward parameter order does not match the tuple input order in `jit.trace`, like a text classification model, `jit.trace` will fail and we are capturing this with the exception here to make it fallback. Logging is used to notify users. ## IPEX graph optimization\\nIntel® Extension for PyTorch (IPEX) provides further optimizations in JIT mode for Intel CPUs, and we recommend combining it with TorchScript for even faster performance.

It leverages the pre-trained contextual embeddings from [BERT](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased) models and matches words in candidate and reference sentences by cosine similarity. Moreover, BERTScore computes precision, recall, and F1 measure, which can be useful for evaluating different language generation tasks. ## How to use\\nBERTScore takes 3 mandatory arguments : `predictions` (a list of string of candidate sentences), `references` (a list of strings or list of list of strings of reference sentences) and either `lang` (a string of two letters indicating the language of the sentences, in [ISO 639-1 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\\\_of\\\\_ISO\\\\_639-1\\\\_codes)) or `model\\\\_type` (a string specififying which model to use, according to the BERT specification). The default behavior of the metric is to use the suggested model for the target language when one is specified, otherwise to use the `model\\\\_type` indicated. ```python\\nfrom datasets import load\\\\_metric\\nbertscore = load\\\\_metric(\"bertscore\")\\npredictions = [\"hello there\", \"general kenobi\"]\\nreferences = [\"hello there\", \"general kenobi\"]\\nresults = bertscore.compute(predictions=predictions, references=references, lang=\"en\")\\n```\\nBERTScore also accepts multiple optional arguments:\\n`num\\\\_layers` (int): The layer of representation to use.\\n\\nthe contradiction score. This is sometimes called \"multi-class multi-label\" classification. - `--temperature` (default: `1.0`): The temperature applied to the softmax of the teacher model predictions. A\\nhigher temperature results in a student with smoother (lower confidence) predictions than the teacher while a value\\n`<1` resultings in a higher-confidence, peaked distribution. The default `1.0` is equivalent to no smoothing. - `--teacher\\\\_batch\\\\_size` (default: `32`): The batch size used for generating a single set of teacher predictions. Does not affect training. Use `--per\\\\_device\\\\_train\\\\_batch\\\\_size` to change the training batch size.

It leverages the pre-trained contextual embeddings from [BERT](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased) models and matches words in candidate and reference sentences by cosine similarity. Moreover, BERTScore computes precision, recall, and F1 measure, which can be useful for evaluating different language generation tasks. ## How to use\\nBERTScore takes 3 mandatory arguments : `predictions` (a list of string of candidate sentences), `references` (a list of strings or list of list of strings of reference sentences) and either `lang` (a string of two letters indicating the language of the sentences, in [ISO 639-1 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\\\_of\\\\_ISO\\\\_639-1\\\\_codes)) or `model\\\\_type` (a string specififying which model to use, according to the BERT specification). The default behavior of the metric is to use the suggested model for the target language when one is specified, otherwise to use the `model\\\\_type` indicated. ```python\\nfrom datasets import load\\\\_metric\\nbertscore = load\\\\_metric(\"bertscore\")\\npredictions = [\"hello there\", \"general kenobi\"]\\nreferences = [\"hello there\", \"general kenobi\"]\\nresults = bertscore.compute(predictions=predictions, references=references, lang=\"en\")\\n```\\nBERTScore also accepts multiple optional arguments:\\n`num\\\\_layers` (int): The layer of representation to use.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 3, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.9971545'}}, 'page_content': 'the contradiction score.

It is based on an [inverted residual structure](https://paperswithcode.com/method/inverted-residual-block) where the residual connections are between the bottleneck layers. The intermediate expansion layer uses lightweight depthwise convolutions to filter features as a source of non-linearity. As a whole, the architecture of MobileNetV2 contains the initial fully convolution layer with 32 filters, followed by 19 residual bottleneck layers. ## How do I use this model on an image?

You can follow the [timm recipe scripts](../scripts) for training a new model afresh. ## Citation\\n```BibTeX\\n@article{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1801-04381,\\nauthor = {Mark Sandler and\\nAndrew G.

It is based on an [inverted residual structure](https://paperswithcode.com/method/inverted-residual-block) where the residual connections are between the bottleneck layers. The intermediate expansion layer uses lightweight depthwise convolutions to filter features as a source of non-linearity.

T2I-Adapter aligns internal knowledge in T2I models with external control signals. We can train various adapters according to different conditions and achieve rich control and editing effects. As a contemporaneous work, [ControlNet](https://hf.co/papers/2302.05543) has a similar function and is widely used. However, it can be \\\\*\\\\*computationally expensive\\\\*\\\\* to run. This is because, during each denoising step of the reverse diffusion process, both the ControlNet and UNet need to be run. In addition, ControlNet emphasizes the importance of copying the UNet encoder as a control model, resulting in a larger parameter number. Thus, the generation is bottlenecked by the size of the ControlNet (the larger, the slower the process becomes). T2I-Adapters provide a competitive advantage to ControlNets in this matter. T2I-Adapters are smaller in size, and unlike ControlNets, T2I-Adapters are run just once for the entire course of the denoising process. | \\\\*\\\\*Model Type\\\\*\\\\* | \\\\*\\\\*Model Parameters\\\\*\\\\* | \\\\*\\\\*Storage (fp16)\\\\*\\\\* |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| [ControlNet-SDXL](https://huggingface.co/diffusers/controlnet-canny-sdxl-1.0) | 1251 M | 2.5 GB |\\n| [ControlLoRA](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/control-lora) (with rank 128) | 197.78 M (84.19% reduction) | 396 MB (84.53% reduction) |\\n| [T2I-Adapter-SDXL](https://huggingface.co/TencentARC/t2i-adapter-canny-sdxl-1.0) | 79 M (\\\\*\\\\*\\\\_93.69% reduction\\\\_\\\\*\\\\*) | 158 MB (\\\\*\\\\*\\\\_94% reduction\\\\_\\\\*\\\\*) |\\nOver the past few weeks, the Diffusers team and the T2I-Adapter authors have been collaborating to bring the support of T2I-Adapters for [Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)](https://huggingface.co/papers/2307.01952) in [`diffusers`](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers).

T2I-Adapter aligns internal knowledge in T2I models with external control signals. We can train various adapters according to different conditions and achieve rich control and editing effects. As a contemporaneous work, [ControlNet](https://hf.co/papers/2302.05543) has a similar function and is widely used. However, it can be \\\\*\\\\*computationally expensive\\\\*\\\\* to run. This is because, during each denoising step of the reverse diffusion process, both the ControlNet and UNet need to be run. In addition, ControlNet emphasizes the importance of copying the UNet encoder as a control model, resulting in a larger parameter number. Thus, the generation is bottlenecked by the size of the ControlNet (the larger, the slower the process becomes). T2I-Adapters provide a competitive advantage to ControlNets in this matter. T2I-Adapters are smaller in size, and unlike ControlNets, T2I-Adapters are run just once for the entire course of the denoising process. | \\\\*\\\\*Model Type\\\\*\\\\* | \\\\*\\\\*Model Parameters\\\\*\\\\* | \\\\*\\\\*Storage (fp16)\\\\*\\\\* |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| [ControlNet-SDXL](https://huggingface.co/diffusers/controlnet-canny-sdxl-1.0) | 1251 M | 2.5 GB |\\n| [ControlLoRA](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/control-lora) (with rank 128) | 197.78 M (84.19% reduction) | 396 MB (84.53% reduction) |\\n| [T2I-Adapter-SDXL](https://huggingface.co/TencentARC/t2i-adapter-canny-sdxl-1.0) | 79 M (\\\\*\\\\*\\\\_93.69% reduction\\\\_\\\\*\\\\*) | 158 MB (\\\\*\\\\*\\\\_94% reduction\\\\_\\\\*\\\\*) |\\nOver the past few weeks, the Diffusers team and the T2I-Adapter authors have been collaborating to bring the support of T2I-Adapters for [Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)](https://huggingface.co/papers/2307.01952) in [`diffusers`](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers).

In this video, we will see what happens during the pre-tokenization step. The pre-tokenization operation is the operation performed after the normalization of the text and before the application of the tokenization algorithm. This step consists in applying rules that do not need to be learned to perform a first division of the text. Let\\'s look at how several tokenizers pre\\\\_tokenize this example. The gpt 2 pretokenization divides the text on spaces and some punctuation - but the apostrophe is not a division criterion for example. We also notice that spaces have been replaced by a capital G with a dot above. Albert\\'s pre-tokenization divides the text at the level of spaces, adds a space at the beginning of the sentence and replaces spaces with a special underscore. Finally, Bert\\'s pre-tokenization divides the text at the level of punctuation and spaces. Unlike the previous tokenizers, spaces are not transformed and integrated to the tokens produced with this pre-tokenizer. Through these 3 examples, we could observe the two main types of operations brought by the pre-tokenization: some changes on the text and the division of the string into tokens that can be associated to words. Finally, the \"backend\\\\_tokenizer\" of the fast tokenizers also allows to test the pre-tokenization operation very easily thanks to its \"pre\\\\_tokenize\\\\_str\" method. We notice that the output of this operation is composed of both tokens and offsets which allow to link the token to its position in the text given in input of the method.\\n\\net\\'s take a look at subword-based tokenization. Understanding why subword-based tokenization is interesting requires understanding the flaws of word-based and character-based tokenization. If you haven\\'t seen the first videos on word-based and character-based tokenization, we recommend you check them out before looking at this video. Subword-tokenization lies in between character-based and word-based tokenization algorithms. The idea is to find a middle ground between very large vocabularies, large quantity of out-of-vocabulary tokens, loss of meaning across very similar words, for word-based tokenizers, and very long sequences, less meaningful individual tokens for character-based tokenizers. These algorithms rely on the following principle: frequently used words should not be split into smaller subwords, but rare words should be decomposed into meaningful subwords. An example is the word dog: we would like to have our tokenizer to have a single ID for the word dog, rather than splitting it into characters: d, o, and g. However, when encountering the word dogs, we would like our tokenizer to understand that at the root, this is still the word dog, with an added s while slightly changes the meaning while keeping the original idea. Another example is a complex word like tokenization, which can be split into meaningful subwords. The root of the word is token, and ization completes the root to give it a slightly different meaning. It makes sense to split the word into two: token, as the root of the word (labeled as the \"start\" of the word). ization as additional information (labeled as a \"completion\" of the word).\\n\\nn this video we will see together what is the purpose of training a tokenizer, what are the key steps to follow and what is the easiest way to do it. You will ask yourself the question \"Should I train a new tokenizer?\" when you plan to train a new model from scratch. A trained tokenizer would not be suitable for your corpus if your corpus is in a different language, uses new characters such as accents or upper cased letters, has a specific vocabulary, for example medical or legal, or uses a different style, a language from another century for instance. For example, if I take the tokenizer trained for the bert-base-uncased model and ignore its normalization step then we can see that the tokenization operation on the English sentence \"here is a sentence adapted to our tokenizer\" produces a rather satisfactory list of tokens in the sense that this sentence of 8 words is tokenized into 9 tokens. On the other hand if we use this same tokenizer on a sentence in Bengali, we see that either a word is divided into many sub tokens or that the tokenizer does not know one of the unicode characters and returns only an unknown token. The fact that a \"common\" word is split into many tokens can be problematic because language models can only handle a sequence of tokens of limited length. A tokenizer that excessively splits your initial text may even impact the performance of your model. Unknown tokens are also problematic because the model will not be able to extract any information from the \"unknown\" part of the text. In this other example, we can see that the tokenizer replaces words containing characters with accents and capital letters with unknown tokens. Finally, if we use again this tokenizer to tokenize medical vocabulary we see again that a single word is divided into many sub tokens: 4 for \"paracetamol\" and \"pharyngitis\".', 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': 'ce99c404-0444-4c2b-a128-fd507b5f6a68', 'tool_call_id': 'call_lJ90fbIVfrD4RhIsUQmD2DGv', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 9, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.99750787'}}, 'page_content': 'he tokenization pipeline involves several steps that convert raw text into numbers. In this video, we will see what happens during the pre-tokenization step. The pre-tokenization operation is the operation performed after the normalization of the text and before the application of the tokenization algorithm. This step consists in applying rules that do not need to be learned to perform a first division of the text. Let\\'s look at how several tokenizers pre\\\\_tokenize this example. The gpt 2 pretokenization divides the text on spaces and some punctuation - but the apostrophe is not a division criterion for example. We also notice that spaces have been replaced by a capital G with a dot above. Albert\\'s pre-tokenization divides the text at the level of spaces, adds a space at the beginning of the sentence and replaces spaces with a special underscore. Finally, Bert\\'s pre-tokenization divides the text at the level of punctuation and spaces. Unlike the previous tokenizers, spaces are not transformed and integrated to the tokens produced with this pre-tokenizer. Through these 3 examples, we could observe the two main types of operations brought by the pre-tokenization: some changes on the text and the division of the string into tokens that can be associated to words. Finally, the \"backend\\\\_tokenizer\" of the fast tokenizers also allows to test the pre-tokenization operation very easily thanks to its \"pre\\\\_tokenize\\\\_str\" method. We notice that the output of this operation is composed of both tokens and offsets which allow to link the token to its position in the text given in input of the method.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 1, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.9952098'}}, 'page_content': 'et\\'s take a look at subword-based tokenization. Understanding why subword-based tokenization is interesting requires understanding the flaws of word-based and character-based tokenization. If you haven\\'t seen the first videos on word-based and character-based tokenization, we recommend you check them out before looking at this video. Subword-tokenization lies in between character-based and word-based tokenization algorithms. The idea is to find a middle ground between very large vocabularies, large quantity of out-of-vocabulary tokens, loss of meaning across very similar words, for word-based tokenizers, and very long sequences, less meaningful individual tokens for character-based tokenizers. These algorithms rely on the following principle: frequently used words should not be split into smaller subwords, but rare words should be decomposed into meaningful subwords. An example is the word dog: we would like to have our tokenizer to have a single ID for the word dog, rather than splitting it into characters: d, o, and g. However, when encountering the word dogs, we would like our tokenizer to understand that at the root, this is still the word dog, with an added s while slightly changes the meaning while keeping the original idea. Another example is a complex word like tokenization, which can be split into meaningful subwords. The root of the word is token, and ization completes the root to give it a slightly different meaning. It makes sense to split the word into two: token, as the root of the word (labeled as the \"start\" of the word). ization as additional information (labeled as a \"completion\" of the word).', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 14, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.9947176'}}, 'page_content': 'n this video we will see together what is the purpose of training a tokenizer, what are the key steps to follow and what is the easiest way to do it.

Here is an example with three splits, `train`, `test`, and `random`:\\n```\\nmy\\\\_dataset\\\\_repository/\\n├── README.md\\n└── data/\\n├── train-00000-of-00003.csv\\n├── train-00001-of-00003.csv\\n├── train-00002-of-00003.csv\\n├── test-00000-of-00001.csv\\n├── random-00000-of-00003.csv\\n├── random-00001-of-00003.csv\\n└── random-00002-of-00003.csv\\n```\", 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 16, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.9991325'}}, 'page_content': 'The final training corpus has a size of 3 GB, which is still small – for your model, you will get better results the more data you can get to pretrain on. ## 2.

We recommend training a byte-level BPE (rather than let’s say, a WordPiece tokenizer like BERT) because it will start building its vocabulary from an alphabet of single bytes, so all words will be decomposable into tokens (no more `` tokens!). ```python\\n#! pip install tokenizers\\nfrom pathlib import Path\\nfrom tokenizers import ByteLevelBPETokenizer\\npaths = [str(x) for x in Path(\"./eo\\\\_data/\").glob(\"\\\\*\\\\*/\\\\*.txt\")]\\n# Initialize a tokenizer\\ntokenizer = ByteLevelBPETokenizer()\\n# Customize training\\ntokenizer.train(files=paths, vocab\\\\_size=52\\\\_000, min\\\\_frequency=2, special\\\\_tokens=[\\n\"~~\",\\n\"\",\\n\"~~\",\\n\"\",\\n\"\",\\n])\\n# Save files to disk\\ntokenizer.save\\\\_model(\".\", \"esperberto\")\\n```\\nAnd here’s a slightly accelerated capture of the output:\\n![tokenizers](assets/01\\\\_how-to-train/tokenizers-fast.gif)\\nOn our dataset, training took about ~5 minutes.', 'type': 'Document'}}, {'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 9, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.9989196'}}, 'page_content': '### Download and extract the data.

The first step is to get one, for instance by using a colab notebook. Then you need to actually send your model and training data on it by using a torch device. Double-check the following lines print a CUDA device for you! We can now put everything together! First we put our model in training mode (which will activate the training behavior for some layers like Dropout) then go through the number of epochs we picked and all the data in our training dataloader. Then we go through all the steps we have seen already: send the data to the GPU, compute the model outputs, and in particular the loss. Use the loss to compute gradients, then make a training step with the optimizer. Update the learning rate in our scheduler for the next iteration and zero the gradients of the optimizer. Once this is finished, we can evaluate our model very easily with a metric from the Datasets library. First we put our model in evaluation mode, then go through all the data in the evaluation data loader. As we have seen in the Trainer video, the model outputs logits and we need to apply the argmax function to convert them into predictions. The metric object then has an add\\\\_batch method we can use to send it those intermediate predictions.\\n\\nAlong with complete equivalence to regular distributed training and easy scalability, this method also has the benefit of built-in fault tolerance, which we illustrate below. Let's consider a couple of potential failure cases that we might encounter throughout a collaborative experiment. By far, the most frequent scenario is that one or several peers disconnect from the training procedure: they might have an unstable connection or simply want to use their GPUs for something else. In this case, we only suffer a minor setback of training: the contribution of these peers gets deducted from the currently accumulated batch size, but other participants will compensate for that with their gradients. Also, if more peers join, the target batch size will simply be reached faster, and our training procedure will naturally speed up.

For parameters that are small, consider also [Dimension Quantization Effects](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/dl-performance-matrix-multiplication/index.html#dim-quantization). This is where tiling happens and the right multiplier can have a significant speedup. ## Gradient Accumulation\\nThe \\\\*\\\\*gradient accumulation\\\\*\\\\* method aims to calculate gradients in smaller increments instead of computing them for the\\nentire batch at once. This approach involves iteratively calculating gradients in smaller batches by performing forward\\nand backward passes through the model and accumulating the gradients during the process. Once a sufficient number of\\ngradients have been accumulated, the model's optimization step is executed. By employing gradient accumulation, it\\nbecomes possible to increase the \\\\*\\\\*effective batch size\\\\*\\\\* beyond the limitations imposed by the GPU's memory capacity. However, it is important to note that the additional forward and backward passes introduced by gradient accumulation can\\nslow down the training process. You can enable gradient accumulation by adding the `gradient\\\\_accumulation\\\\_steps` argument to [`TrainingArguments`]:\\n```py\\ntraining\\\\_args = TrainingArguments(per\\\\_device\\\\_train\\\\_batch\\\\_size=1, gradient\\\\_accumulation\\\\_steps=4, \\\\*\\\\*default\\\\_args)\\n```\\nIn the above example, your effective batch size becomes 4.\", 'type': 'tool', 'name': 'data_retriever', 'id': 'f4d889ca-ce44-4bda-88a9-2353450e8cf0', 'tool_call_id': 'call_lOlAamGiIAySxGd2SG7hPwDH', 'artifact': [{'lc': 1, 'type': 'constructor', 'id': ['langchain', 'schema', 'document', 'Document'], 'kwargs': {'metadata': {'id': 7, 'relevance_score': {'lc': 1, 'type': 'not_implemented', 'id': ['numpy', 'float32'], 'repr': '0.9980425'}}, 'page_content': 'Finally, if we want our training to take a couple of minutes instead of a few hours, we will need to use a GPU.

Double-check the following lines print a CUDA device for you! We can now put everything together!
