The LLaMA tokenizer is a BPE model based on [sentencepiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece). One quirk of sentencepiece is that when decoding a sequence, if the first token is the start of the word (e.g. \""Banana\""), the tokenizer does not prepend the prefix space to the string.

It enables zero-shot subject-driven generation and control-guided zero-shot generation. The abstract from the paper is:\n\\*Subject-driven text-to-image generation models create novel renditions of an input subject based on text prompts. Existing models suffer from lengthy fine-tuning and difficulties preserving the subject fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce BLIP-Diffusion, a new subject-driven image generation model that supports multimodal control which consumes inputs of subject images and text prompts. Unlike other subject-driven generation models, BLIP-Diffusion introduces a new multimodal encoder which is pre-trained to provide subject representation. We first pre-train the multimodal encoder following BLIP-2 to produce visual representation aligned with the text. Then we design a subject representation learning task which enables a diffusion model to leverage such visual representation and generates new subject renditions. Compared with previous methods such as DreamBooth, our model enables zero-shot subject-driven generation, and efficient fine-tuning for customized subject with up to 20x speedup. We also demonstrate that BLIP-Diffusion can be flexibly combined with existing techniques such as ControlNet and prompt-to-prompt to enable novel subject-driven generation and editing applications.

In this work, we present MultiDiffusion, a unified framework that enables versatile and controllable image generation, using a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, without any further training or finetuning. At the center of our approach is a new generation process, based on an optimization task that binds together multiple diffusion generation processes with a shared set of parameters or constraints. We show that MultiDiffusion can be readily applied to generate high quality and diverse images that adhere to user-provided controls, such as desired aspect ratio (e.g., panorama), and spatial guiding signals, ranging from tight segmentation masks to bounding boxes.\\*\nYou can find additional information about MultiDiffusion on the [project page](https://multidiffusion.github.io/), [original codebase](https://github.com/omerbt/MultiDiffusion), and try it out in a [demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/weizmannscience/MultiDiffusion).""]","The purpose of the BLIP-Diffusion model is to enable zero-shot subject-driven generation and control-guided zero-shot generation in text-to-image generation tasks.

It's an\nencoder-decoder transformer pre-trained in a text-to-text denoising generative setting. LongT5 model is an extension of\nT5 model, and it enables using one of the two different efficient attention mechanisms - (1) Local attention, or (2)\nTransient-Global attention. The abstract from the paper is the following:\n\\*Recent work has shown that either (1) increasing the input length or (2) increasing model size can improve the\nperformance of Transformer-based neural models. In this paper, we present a new model, called LongT5, with which we\nexplore the effects of scaling both the input length and model size at the same time. Specifically, we integrated\nattention ideas from long-input transformers (ETC), and adopted pre-training strategies from summarization pre-training\n(PEGASUS) into the scalable T5 architecture. The result is a new attention mechanism we call {\\em Transient Global}\n(TGlobal), which mimics ETC's local/global attention mechanism, but without requiring additional side-inputs. We are\nable to achieve state-of-the-art results on several summarization tasks and outperform the original T5 models on\nquestion answering tasks.\\*\nThis model was contributed by [stancld](https://huggingface.co/stancld). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/longt5). ## Usage tips\n- [`LongT5ForConditionalGeneration`] is an extension of [`T5ForConditionalGeneration`] exchanging the traditional\nencoder \\*self-attention\\* layer with efficient either \\*local\\* attention or \\*transient-global\\* (\\*tglobal\\*) attention. - Unlike the T5 model, LongT5 does not use a task prefix. Furthermore, it uses a different pre-training objective\ninspired by the pre-training of [`PegasusForConditionalGeneration`]. - LongT5 model is designed to work efficiently and very well on long-range \\*sequence-to-sequence\\* tasks where the\ninput sequence exceeds commonly used 512 tokens. It is capable of handling input sequences of a length up to 16,384 tokens. - For \\*Local Attention\\*, the sparse sliding-window local attention operation allows a given token to attend only `r`\ntokens to the left and right of it (with `r=127` by default). \\*Local Attention\\* does not introduce any new parameters\nto the model. The complexity of the mechanism is linear in input sequence length `l`: `O(l\\*r)`. - \\*Transient Global Attention\\* is an extension of the \\*Local Attention\\*. It, furthermore, allows each input token to\ninteract with all other tokens in the layer. This is achieved via splitting an input sequence into blocks of a fixed\nlength `k` (with a default `k=16`). Then, a global token for such a block is obtained via summing and normalizing the embeddings of every token\nin the block. Thanks to this, the attention allows each token to attend to both nearby tokens like in Local attention, and\nalso every global token like in the case of standard global attention (\\*transient\\* represents the fact the global tokens\nare constructed dynamically within each attention operation). As a consequence, \\*TGlobal\\* attention introduces\na few new parameters -- global relative position biases and a layer normalization for global token's embedding.""]","The default context window size for Local Attention in the LongT5 model is set to `r=127`, which means a given token can attend to 127 tokens to the left and 127 tokens to the right of it.",127 tokens
"What method is used to load a checkpoint for a task using `AutoPipeline`?
","[""The `AutoPipeline` class is designed to simplify the variety of pipelines in 🤗 Diffusers. It is a generic, \\*task-first\\* pipeline that lets you focus on the task. The `AutoPipeline` automatically detects the correct pipeline class to use, which makes it easier to load a checkpoint for a task without knowing the specific pipeline class name. Take a look at the [AutoPipeline](../api/pipelines/auto\\_pipeline) reference to see which tasks are supported. Currently, it supports text-to-image, image-to-image, and inpainting. This tutorial shows you how to use an `AutoPipeline` to automatically infer the pipeline class to load for a specific task, given the pretrained weights. ## Choose an AutoPipeline for your task\nStart by picking a checkpoint. For example, if you're interested in text-to-image with the [runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5) checkpoint, use [`AutoPipelineForText2Image`]:\n```py\nfrom diffusers import AutoPipelineForText2Image\nimport torch\npipeline = AutoPipelineForText2Image.from\\_pretrained(\n\""runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5\"", torch\\_dtype=torch.float16, use\\_safetensors=True\n).to(\""cuda\"")\nprompt = \""peasant and dragon combat, wood cutting style, viking era, bevel with rune\""\nimage = pipeline(prompt, num\\_inference\\_steps=25).images[0]\nimage\n```\n\n![generated image of peasant fighting dragon in wood cutting style](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/diffusers/autopipeline-text2img.png)\n\nUnder the hood, [`AutoPipelineForText2Image`]:\n1. automatically detects a `\""stable-diffusion\""` class from the [`model\\_index.json`](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5/blob/main/model\\_index.json) file\n2. loads the corresponding text-to-image [`StableDiffusionPipeline`] based on the `\""stable-diffusion\""` class name\nLikewise, for image-to-image, [`AutoPipelineForImage2Image`] detects a `\""stable-diffusion\""` checkpoint from the `model\\_index.json` file and it'll load the corresponding [`StableDiffusionImg2ImgPipeline`] behind the scenes. You can also pass any additional arguments specific to the pipeline class such as `strength`, which determines the amount of noise or variation added to an input image:\n```py\nfrom diffusers import AutoPipelineForImage2Image\nimport torch\nimport requests\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom io import BytesIO\npipeline = AutoPipelineForImage2Image.from\\_pretrained(\n\""runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5\"",\ntorch\\_dtype=torch.float16,\nuse\\_safetensors=True,\n).to(\""cuda\"")\nprompt = \""a portrait of a dog wearing a pearl earring\""\nurl = \""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/1665\\_Girl\\_with\\_a\\_Pearl\\_Earring.jpg/800px-1665\\_Girl\\_with\\_a\\_Pearl\\_Earring.jpg\""\nresponse = requests.get(url)\nimage = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content)).convert(\""RGB\"")\nimage.thumbnail((768, 768))\nimage = pipeline(prompt, image, num\\_inference\\_steps=200, strength=0.75, guidance\\_scale=10.5).images[0]\nimage\n```\n\n![generated image of a vermeer portrait of a dog wearing a pearl earring](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/diffusers/autopipeline-img2img.png)\n\nAnd if you want to do inpainting, then [`AutoPipelineForInpainting`] loads the underlying [`StableDiffusionInpaintPipeline`] class in the same way:\n```py\nfrom diffusers import AutoPipelineForInpainting\nfrom diffusers.utils import load\\_image\nimport torch\npipeline = AutoPipelineForInpainting.from\\_pretrained(\n\""stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0\"", torch\\_dtype=torch.float16, use\\_safetensors=True\n).to(\""cuda\"")\nimg\\_url = \""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion/main/data/inpainting\\_examples/overture-creations-5sI6fQgYIuo.png\""\nmask\\_url = \""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion/main/data/inpainting\\_examples/overture-creations-5sI6fQgYIuo\\_mask.png\""\ninit\\_image = load\\_image(img\\_url).convert(\""RGB\"")\nmask\\_image = load\\_image(mask\\_url).convert(\""RGB\"")\nprompt = \""A majestic tiger sitting on a bench\""\nimage = pipeline(prompt, image=init\\_image, mask\\_image=mask\\_image, num\\_inference\\_steps=50, strength=0.80).images[0]\nimage\n```\n\n![generated image of a tiger sitting on a bench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/diffusers/autopipeline-inpaint.png)\n\nIf you try to load an unsupported checkpoint, it'll throw an error:\n```py\nfrom diffusers import AutoPipelineForImage2Image\nimport torch\npipeline = AutoPipelineForImage2Image.from\\_pretrained(\n\""openai/shap-e-img2img\"", torch\\_dtype=torch.float16, use\\_safetensors=True\n)\n\""ValueError: AutoPipeline can't find a pipeline linked to ShapEImg2ImgPipeline for None\""\n```\n## Use multiple pipelines\nFor some workflows or if you're loading many pipelines, it is more memory-efficient to reuse the same components from a checkpoint instead of reloading them which would unnecessarily consume additional memory."", ""!--Copyright 2023 The HuggingFace Team.

Its purpose is to serve as a \\*\\*modular toolbox\\*\\* for both inference and training. We aim at building a library that stands the test of time and therefore take API design very seriously. In a nutshell, Diffusers is built to be a natural extension of PyTorch. Therefore, most of our design choices are based on [PyTorch's Design Principles](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/community/design.html#pytorch-design-philosophy). Let's go over the most important ones:\n## Usability over Performance\n- While Diffusers has many built-in performance-enhancing features (see [Memory and Speed](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/fp16)), models are always loaded with the highest precision and lowest optimization. Therefore, by default diffusion pipelines are always instantiated on CPU with float32 precision if not otherwise defined by the user. This ensures usability across different platforms and accelerators and means that no complex installations are required to run the library. - Diffusers aims to be a \\*\\*light-weight\\*\\* package and therefore has very few required dependencies, but many soft dependencies that can improve performance (such as `accelerate`, `safetensors`, `onnx`, etc...). We strive to keep the library as lightweight as possible so that it can be added without much concern as a dependency on other packages. - Diffusers prefers simple, self-explainable code over condensed, magic code. This means that short-hand code syntaxes such as lambda functions, and advanced PyTorch operators are often not desired. ## Simple over easy\nAs PyTorch states, \\*\\*explicit is better than implicit\\*\\* and \\*\\*simple is better than complex\\*\\*."", ""!--Copyright 2023 The HuggingFace Team.

A scheduler takes a model's output (the sample which the diffusion process is iterating on) and a timestep to return a denoised sample. The timestep is important because it dictates where in the diffusion process the step is; data is generated by iterating forward \\*n\\* timesteps and inference occurs by propagating backward through the timesteps. Based on the timestep, a scheduler may be \\*discrete\\* in which case the timestep is an `int` or \\*continuous\\* in which case the timestep is a `float`. Depending on the context, a scheduler defines how to iteratively add noise to an image or how to update a sample based on a model's output:\n- during \\*training\\*, a scheduler adds noise (there are different algorithms for how to add noise) to a sample to train a diffusion model\n- during \\*inference\\*, a scheduler defines how to update a sample based on a pretrained model's output\nMany schedulers are implemented from the [k-diffusion](https://github.com/crowsonkb/k-diffusion) library by [Katherine Crowson](https://github.com/crowsonkb/), and they're also widely used in A1111.

"What is the purpose of the `gradio.Blocks` API?
","[""Introduction to Gradio Blocks[[introduction-to-gradio-blocks]]\nIn the previous sections we have explored and created demos using the `Interface` class. In this section we will introduce our \\*\\*newly developed\\*\\* low-level API called `gradio.Blocks`. Now, what's the difference between `Interface` and `Blocks`? - ⚡ `Interface`: a high-level API that allows you to create a full machine learning demo simply by providing a list of inputs and outputs. - 🧱 `Blocks`: a low-level API that allows you to have full control over the data flows and layout of your application. You can build very complex, multi-step applications using `Blocks` (as in \""building blocks\""). ### Why Blocks 🧱?[[why-blocks-]]\nAs we saw in the previous sections, the `Interface` class allows you to easily create full-fledged machine learning demos with just a few lines of code. The `Interface` API is extremely easy to use but lacks the flexibility that the `Blocks` API provides. For example, you might want to:\n- Group together related demos as multiple tabs in one web application\n- Change the layout of your demo, e.g. to specify where the inputs and outputs are located\n- Have multi-step interfaces, in which the output of one model becomes the input to the next model, or have more flexible data flows in general\n- Change a component's properties (for example, the choices in a dropdown) or its visibility based on user input\nWe will explore all of these concepts below. ### Creating a simple demo using Blocks[[creating-a-simple-demo-using-blocks]]\nAfter you have installed Gradio, run the code below as a Python script, a Jupyter notebook, or a Colab notebook. ```py\nimport gradio as gr\ndef flip\\_text(x):\nreturn x[::-1]\ndemo = gr.Blocks()\nwith demo:\ngr.Markdown(\n\""\""\""\n# Flip Text! Start typing below to see the output. \""\""\""\n)\ninput = gr.Textbox(placeholder=\""Flip this text\"")\noutput = gr.Textbox()\ninput.change(fn=flip\\_text, inputs=input, outputs=output)\ndemo.launch()\n```\nThis simple example above introduces 4 concepts that underlie Blocks:\n1. Blocks allow you to build web applications that combine markdown, HTML, buttons, and interactive components simply by instantiating objects in Python inside of a `with gradio.Blocks` context."", ""### An Overview of Gradio\nSo far, we've been discussing the `Interface` class, which is a high-level class that lets to build demos quickly with Gradio. But what else does Gradio do? #### Chatbots with `gr.ChatInterface`\nGradio includes another high-level class, `gr.ChatInterface`, which is specifically designed to create Chatbot UIs. Similar to `Interface`, you supply a function and Gradio creates a fully working Chatbot UI. If you're interested in creating a chatbot, you can jump straight [our dedicated guide on `gr.ChatInterface`](https://www.gradio.app/guides/creating-a-chatbot-fast). #### Custom Demos with `gr.Blocks`\nGradio also offers a low-level approach for designing web apps with more flexible layouts and data flows with the `gr.Blocks` class. Blocks allows you to do things like control where components appear on the page, handle complex data flows (e.g. outputs can serve as inputs to other functions), and update properties/visibility of components based on user interaction — still all in Python. You can build very custom and complex applications using `gr.Blocks()`. For example, the popular image generation [Automatic1111 Web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) is built using Gradio Blocks. We dive deeper into the `gr.Blocks` on our series on [building with Blocks](https://www.gradio.app/guides/blocks-and-event-listeners). #### The Gradio Python & JavaScript Ecosystem\nThat's the gist of the core `gradio` Python library, but Gradio is actually so much more! Its an entire ecosystem of Python and JavaScript libraries that let you build machine learning applications, or query them programmatically, in Python or JavaScript. Here are other related parts of the Gradio ecosystem:\n\\* [Gradio Python Client](https://www.gradio.app/guides/getting-started-with-the-python-client) (`gradio\\_client`): query any Gradio app programmatically in Python. \\* [Gradio JavaScript Client](https://www.gradio.app/guides/getting-started-with-the-js-client) (`@gradio/client`): query any Gradio app programmatically in JavaScript. \\* [Gradio-Lite](https://www.gradio.app/guides/gradio-lite) (`@gradio/lite`): write Gradio apps in Python that run entirely in the browser (no server needed!), thanks to Pyodide. \\* [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces): the most popular place to host Gradio applications — for free!"", ""All components are now keyboard navigable and include better colors to be usable by a wider audience. ![](https://media0.giphy.com/media/Kv1bAN7MX3ya5krkEU/giphy.gif)\n\\*\\*3.

Its aim is to make cutting-edge NLP easier to use for everyone. [UNK] Transformers provides APIs to quickly download and use those pretrained models on a given text, fine-tune them on your own datasets and\nthen share them with the community on our model hub. At the same time, each python module defining an architecture is fully standalone and\ncan be modified to enable quick research experiments. Why should I use transformers? 1. Easy-to-use state-of-the-art models:\n- High performance on NLU and NLG tasks. - Low barrier to entry for educators and practitioners. - Few user-facing abstractions with just three classes to learn. - A unified API for using all our pretrained models. - Lower compute costs, smaller carbon footprint:\n2. Researchers can share trained models instead of always retraining. - Practitioners can reduce compute time and production costs. - Dozens of architectures with over 10,000 pretrained models, some in more than 100 languages."", ""4.

Not really, because relevant is only the output matrix \\\\( \\mathbf{Y}\\_\\text{out} \\\\). To trade memory for speed, one can thus chunk the linear layers computation to only process one chunk at the time. Defining `config.chunk\\_size\\_feed\\_forward` as \\\\( c\\_{f} \\\\), chunked linear layers are defined as \\\\( \\mathbf{Y}\\_{\\text{out}} = \\left[\\mathbf{Y}\\_{\\text{out}, 1: c\\_{f}}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{Y}\\_{\\text{out}, (n - c\\_{f}): n}\\right] \\\\) with \\\\( \\mathbf{Y}\\_{\\text{out}, (c\\_{f} \\* i): (i \\* c\\_{f} + i)} = \\text{Linear}\\_{\\text{out}}(\\text{Linear}\\_{\\text{int}}(\\mathbf{\\overline{Z}}\\_{(c\\_{f} \\* i): (i \\* c\\_{f} + i)})) \\\\).

"What are the two parameter-reduction techniques proposed in the ALBERT model to lower memory consumption and increase training speed?
","[""It presents two parameter-reduction techniques to lower memory consumption and increase the training\nspeed of BERT:\n- Splitting the embedding matrix into two smaller matrices. - Using repeating layers split among groups. The abstract from the paper is the following:\n\\*Increasing model size when pretraining natural language representations often results in improved performance on\ndownstream tasks. However, at some point further model increases become harder due to GPU/TPU memory limitations,\nlonger training times, and unexpected model degradation. To address these problems, we present two parameter-reduction\ntechniques to lower memory consumption and increase the training speed of BERT. Comprehensive empirical evidence shows\nthat our proposed methods lead to models that scale much better compared to the original BERT. We also use a\nself-supervised loss that focuses on modeling inter-sentence coherence, and show it consistently helps downstream tasks\nwith multi-sentence inputs. As a result, our best model establishes new state-of-the-art results on the GLUE, RACE, and\nSQuAD benchmarks while having fewer parameters compared to BERT-large.\\*\nThis model was contributed by [lysandre](https://huggingface.co/lysandre). This model jax version was contributed by\n[kamalkraj](https://huggingface.co/kamalkraj). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/ALBERT). ## Usage tips\n- ALBERT is a model with absolute position embeddings so it's usually advised to pad the inputs on the right rather\nthan the left. - ALBERT uses repeating layers which results in a small memory footprint, however the computational cost remains\nsimilar to a BERT-like architecture with the same number of hidden layers as it has to iterate through the same\nnumber of (repeating) layers. - Embedding size E is different from hidden size H justified because the embeddings are context independent (one embedding vector represents one token), whereas hidden states are context dependent (one hidden state represents a sequence of tokens) so it's more logical to have H >> E. Also, the embedding matrix is large since it's V x E (V being the vocab size). If E < H, it has less parameters. - Layers are split in groups that share parameters (to save memory). Next sentence prediction is replaced by a sentence ordering prediction: in the inputs, we have two sentences A and B (that are consecutive) and we either feed A followed by B or B followed by A."", ""However, most Transformer models continued to trend towards more parameters, leading to new models focused on improving training efficiency. [ALBERT](model\\_doc/albert) reduces memory consumption by lowering the number of parameters in two ways: separating the larger vocabulary embedding into two smaller matrices and allowing layers to share parameters. [DeBERTa](model\\_doc/deberta) added a disentangled attention mechanism where the word and its position are separately encoded in two vectors. The attention is computed from these separate vectors instead of a single vector containing the word and position embeddings. [Longformer](model\\_doc/longformer) also focused on making attention more efficient, especially for processing documents with longer sequence lengths. It uses a combination of local windowed attention (attention only calculated from fixed window size around each token) and global attention (only for specific task tokens like `[CLS]` for classification) to create a sparse attention matrix instead of a full attention matrix. ### Decoder[[nlp-decoder]]\n[GPT-2](model\\_doc/gpt2) is a decoder-only Transformer that predicts the next word in the sequence."", ""!--Copyright 2020 The HuggingFace Team.

Load a dataset from the Hugging Face Hub. 2. Preprocess the data with `Dataset.map()`. 3. Load and compute metrics. But this is just scratching the surface of what 🤗 Datasets can do! In this chapter, we will take a deep dive into the library. Along the way, we'll find answers to the following questions:\n\\* What do you do when your dataset is not on the Hub? \\* How can you slice and dice a dataset? (And what if you \\_really\\_ need to use Pandas?)\n\\* What do you do when your dataset is huge and will melt your laptop's RAM? \\* What the heck are \""memory mapping\"" and Apache Arrow? \\* How can you create your own dataset and push it to the Hub? The techniques you learn here will prepare you for the advanced tokenization and fine-tuning tasks in [Chapter 6](/course/chapter6) and [Chapter 7](/course/chapter7) -- so grab a coffee and let's get started!"", ""To verify that all libraries are correctly installed, you can run the following command in a Python shell. It verifies that both `transformers` and `datasets` have been correclty installed. ```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCTC, AutoProcessor\nfrom datasets import load\\_dataset\ndummy\\_dataset = load\\_dataset(\""common\\_voice\"", \""ab\"", split=\""test\"")\nmodel = AutoModelForCTC.from\\_pretrained(\""hf-internal-testing/tiny-random-wav2vec2\"")\nmodel.to(\""cuda\"")\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from\\_pretrained(\""hf-internal-testing/tiny-random-wav2vec2\"")\ninput\\_values = processor(dummy\\_dataset[0][\""audio\""][\""array\""], return\\_tensors=\""pt\"", sampling\\_rate=16\\_000).input\\_values\ninput\\_values = input\\_values.to(\""cuda\"")\nlogits = model(input\\_values).logits\nassert logits.shape[-1] == 32\n```\n## How to finetune an acoustic model\nIn this section, we show you how to fine-tune a pre-trained [XLS-R Model](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model\\_doc/xls\\_r) on the [Common Voice 7 dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mozilla-foundation/common\\_voice\\_7\\_0)."", ""Considerations for model evaluation\nDeveloping an ML model is rarely a one-shot deal: it often involves multiple stages of defining the model architecture and tuning hyper-parameters before converging on a final set. Responsible model evaluation is a key part of this process, and 🤗 Evaluate is here to help! Here are some things to keep in mind when evaluating your model using the 🤗 Evaluate library:\n## Properly splitting your data\nGood evaluation generally requires three splits of your dataset:\n- \\*\\*train\\*\\*: this is used for training your model. - \\*\\*validation\\*\\*: this is used for validating the model hyperparameters. - \\*\\*test\\*\\*: this is used for evaluating your model. Many of the datasets on the 🤗 Hub are separated into 2 splits: `train` and `validation`; others are split into 3 splits (`train`, `validation` and `test`) -- make sure to use the right split for the right purpose! Some datasets on the 🤗 Hub are already separated into these three splits. However, there are also many that only have a train/validation or only train split. If the dataset you're using doesn't have a predefined train-test split, it is up to you to define which part of the dataset you want to use for training your model and which you want to use for hyperparameter tuning or final evaluation. Training and evaluating on the same split can misrepresent your results! If you overfit on your training data the evaluation results on that split will look great but the model will perform poorly on new data. Depending on the size of the dataset, you can keep anywhere from 10-30% for evaluation and the rest for training, while aiming to set up the test set to reflect the production data as close as possible. Check out [this thread](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/how-to-split-main-dataset-into-train-dev-test-as-datasetdict/1090) for a more in-depth discussion of dataset splitting! ## The impact of class imbalance\nWhile many academic datasets, such as the [IMDb dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imdb) of movie reviews, are perfectly balanced, most real-world datasets are not. In machine learning a \\*balanced dataset\\* corresponds to a datasets where all labels are represented equally. In the case of the IMDb dataset this means that there are as many positive as negative reviews in the dataset. In an imbalanced dataset this is not the case: in fraud detection for example there are usually many more non-fraud cases than fraud cases in the dataset. Having an imbalanced dataset can skew the results of your metrics. Imagine a dataset with 99 \""non-fraud\"" cases and 1 \""fraud\"" case. A simple model that always predicts \""non-fraud\"" cases would give yield a 99% accuracy which might sound good at first until you realize that you will never catch a fraud case.""]","The three main steps for fine-tuning a model with the 🤗 Datasets library are:

"What is the maximum improvement in throughput achieved by Hugging Face Infinity compared to vanilla transformers?
","[""It is remarkable to see how robust and constant Infinity is, with minimal deviation for p95, p99, or p100 (max latency). This result is confirmed for other experiments as well in the benchmark.

We created a detailed benchmark with over 190 different configurations sharing the results you can expect when using Hugging Face Infinity on CPU, what would be the best configuration to optimize your Infinity Container for latency, and what would be the best configuration to maximize throughput. Hugging Face Infinity can deliver up to 800% higher throughput compared to vanilla transformers, and down to 1-4ms latency for sequence lengths up to 64 tokens.

Not only do we strive to advance Transformer models, but we also work hard on simplifying their adoption. Today, we're excited to announce that Intel has officially joined our [Hardware Partner Program](https://huggingface.co/hardware). Thanks to the [Optimum](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel) open-source library, Intel and Hugging Face will collaborate to build state-of-the-art hardware acceleration to train, fine-tune and predict with Transformers. Transformer models are increasingly large and complex, which can cause production challenges for latency-sensitive applications like search or chatbots. Unfortunately, latency optimization has long been a hard problem for Machine Learning (ML) practitioners. Even with deep knowledge of the underlying framework and hardware platform, it takes a lot of trial and error to figure out which knobs and features to leverage. Intel provides a complete foundation for accelerated AI with the Intel Xeon Scalable CPU platform and a wide range of hardware-optimized AI software tools, frameworks, and libraries. Thus, it made perfect sense for Hugging Face and Intel to join forces and collaborate on building powerful model optimization tools that let users achieve the best performance, scale, and productivity on Intel platforms. “\\*We’re excited to work with Hugging Face to bring the latest innovations of Intel Xeon hardware and Intel AI software to the Transformers community, through open source integration and integrated developer experiences.\\*”, says Wei Li, Intel Vice President & General Manager, AI and Analytics. In recent months, Intel and Hugging Face collaborated on scaling Transformer workloads. We published detailed tuning guides and benchmarks on inference ([part 1](https://huggingface.co/blog/bert-cpu-scaling-part-1), [part 2](https://huggingface.co/blog/bert-cpu-scaling-part-2)) and achieved [single-digit millisecond latency](https://huggingface.co/blog/infinity-cpu-performance) for DistilBERT on the latest Intel Xeon Ice Lake CPUs. On the training side, we added support for [Habana Gaudi](https://huggingface.co/blog/getting-started-habana) accelerators, which deliver up to 40% better price-performance than GPUs. The next logical step was to expand on this work and share it with the ML community. Enter the [Optimum Intel](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel) open source library! Let’s take a deeper look at it. ## Get Peak Transformers Performance with Optimum Intel\n[Optimum](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum) is an open-source library created by Hugging Face to simplify Transformer acceleration across a growing range of training and inference devices."", ""This trend has introduced daunting challenges for Machine Learning Engineers when deploying the latest models into production. While 100x speedup is a high bar to reach, that’s what it takes to serve predictions with acceptable latency in real-time consumer applications. To reach that bar, as Machine Learning Engineers at Hugging Face we certainly have an unfair advantage sitting in the same (virtual) offices as the 🤗 Transformers and 🤗 Tokenizers maintainers 😬.

"What is the time and memory complexity of the Nyströmformer's approximation of self-attention?
","[""--\ntitle: \""Nyströmformer: Approximating self-attention in linear time and memory via the Nyström method\""\nthumbnail: /blog/assets/86\\_nystromformer/thumbnail.png\nauthors:\n- user: asi\nguest: true\n---\n# Nyströmformer: Approximating self-attention in linear time and memory via the Nyström method\n## Introduction\nTransformers have exhibited remarkable performance on various Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision tasks. Their success can be attributed to the self-attention mechanism, which captures the pairwise interactions between all the tokens in an input. However, the standard self-attention mechanism has a time and memory complexity of \\\\(O(n^2)\\\\) (where \\\\(n\\\\) is the length of the input sequence), making it expensive to train on long input sequences. The [Nyströmformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03902) is one of many efficient Transformer models that approximates standard self-attention with \\\\(O(n)\\\\) complexity. Nyströmformer exhibits competitive performance on various downstream NLP and CV tasks while improving upon the efficiency of standard self-attention. The aim of this blog post is to give readers an overview of the Nyström method and how it can be adapted to approximate self-attention. ## Nyström method for matrix approximation\nAt the heart of Nyströmformer is the Nyström method for matrix approximation. It allows us to approximate a matrix by sampling some of its rows and columns. Let's consider a matrix \\\\(P^{n \\times n}\\\\), which is expensive to compute in its entirety. So, instead, we approximate it using the Nyström method. We start by sampling \\\\(m\\\\) rows and columns from \\\\(P\\\\). We can then arrange the sampled rows and columns as follows:\n\nRepresenting P as a block matrix\n\nWe now have four submatrices: \\\\(A\\_P, B\\_P, F\\_P,\\\\) and \\\\(C\\_P\\\\), with sizes \\\\(m \\times m, m \\times (n - m), (n - m) \\times m\\\\) and\n\\\\((n - m) \\times (n - m)\\\\) respectively. The \\\\(m\\\\) sampled columns are contained in \\\\(A\\_P\\\\) and \\\\(F\\_P\\\\), whereas the \\\\(m\\\\) sampled rows are contained in \\\\(A\\_P\\\\) and \\\\(B\\_P\\\\). So, the entries of \\\\(A\\_P, B\\_P,\\\\) and \\\\(F\\_P\\\\) are known to us, and we will estimate \\\\(C\\_P\\\\). According to the Nyström method, \\\\(C\\_P\\\\) is given by:\n$$C\\_P = F\\_P A\\_P^+ B\\_P$$\nHere, \\\\(+\\\\) denotes the Moore-Penrose inverse (or pseudoinverse). Thus, the Nyström approximation of \\\\(P, \\hat{P}\\\\) can be written as:\n\nNyström approximation of P\n\nAs shown in the second line, \\\\(\\hat{P}\\\\) can be expressed as a product of three matrices."", ""The abstract from the paper is the following:\n\\*Transformers have emerged as a powerful tool for a broad range of natural language processing tasks. A key component\nthat drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or\ndependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the\ninput sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences -- a topic being actively studied in the\ncommunity. To address this limitation, we propose Nyströmformer -- a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a\nfunction of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nyström method to approximate standard self-attention\nwith O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nyströmformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of\ntokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard\nsequence length, and find that our Nyströmformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than\nstandard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nyströmformer performs\nfavorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.

Our goal is to ultimately approximate the softmax matrix in standard self attention: S = softmax \\\\( \\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d}} \\\\)\nHere, \\\\(Q\\\\) and \\\\(K\\\\) denote the queries and keys respectively. Following the procedure discussed above, we would sample \\\\(m\\\\) rows and columns from \\\\(S\\\\), form four submatrices, and obtain \\\\(\\hat{S}\\\\):\n\nNyström approximation of S\n\nBut, what does it mean to sample a column from \\\\(S\\\\)? It means we select one element from each row. Recall how S is calculated: the final operation is a row-wise softmax. To find a single entry in a row, we must access all other entries (for the denominator in softmax). So, sampling one column requires us to know all other columns in the matrix. Therefore, we cannot directly apply the Nyström method to approximate the softmax matrix. ## How can we adapt the Nyström method to approximate self-attention? Instead of sampling from \\\\(S\\\\), the authors propose to sample landmarks (or Nyström points) from queries and keys. We denote the query landmarks and key landmarks as \\\\(\\tilde{Q}\\\\) and \\\\(\\tilde{K}\\\\) respectively. \\\\(\\tilde{Q}\\\\) and \\\\(\\tilde{K}\\\\) can be used to construct three matrices corresponding to those in the Nyström approximation of \\\\(S\\\\).

We replace the three matrices in the Nyström approximation of \\\\(S\\\\) with the new matrices we have defined to obtain an alternative Nyström approximation:\n$$\\begin{aligned}\\hat{S} &= \\tilde{F} \\tilde{A} \\tilde{B} \\\\ &= softmax(\\frac{Q\\tilde{K}^T}{\\sqrt{d}}) softmax(\\frac{\\tilde{Q}\\tilde{K}^T}{\\sqrt{d}})^+ softmax(\\frac{\\tilde{Q}K^T}{\\sqrt{d}}) \\end{aligned}$$\nThis is the Nyström approximation of the softmax matrix in the self-attention mechanism.""]","The Nyströmformer approximates self-attention with a time and memory complexity of \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input sequence.

The goal of this task is to find the entities in a piece of text, such as person, location, or organization. This task is formulated as labelling each token with one class for each entity, and another class for tokens that have no entity. Another token classification task is part-of-speech tagging. The goal of this task is to label the words for a particular part of a speech, such as noun, pronoun, adjective, verb and so on. This task is formulated as labelling each token with parts of speech. Token classification models are evaluated on Accuracy, Recall, Precision and F1-Score. The metrics are calculated for each of the classes.

"What is the resolution of images used by the CLIPSeg model?
","[""For example, the model uses images of 352 x 352 pixels, so the output is quite low-resolution. This means we cannot expect pixel-perfect results when we work with images from modern cameras. If we want more precise segmentations, we can fine-tune a state-of-the-art segmentation model, as shown in [our previous blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/fine-tune-segformer). In that case, we can still use CLIPSeg to generate some rough labels, and then refine them in a labeling tool such as [Segments.ai](https://segments.ai/?utm\\_source=hf&utm\\_medium=blog&utm\\_campaign=clipseg). Before we describe how to do that, let’s first take a look at how CLIPSeg works. ## CLIP: the magic model behind CLIPSeg\n[CLIP](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model\\_doc/clip), which stands for \\*\\*C\\*\\*ontrastive \\*\\*L\\*\\*anguage–\\*\\*I\\*\\*mage \\*\\*P\\*\\*re-training, is a model developed by OpenAI in 2021. You can give CLIP an image or a piece of text, and CLIP will output an abstract \\*representation\\* of your input. This abstract representation, also called an \\*embedding\\*, is really just a vector (a list of numbers). You can think of this vector as a point in high-dimensional space. CLIP is trained so that the representations of similar pictures and texts are similar as well. This means that if we input an image and a text description that fits that image, the representations of the image and the text will be similar (i.e., the high-dimensional points will be close together)."", ""!--Copyright 2022 The HuggingFace Team.

CLIPSeg adds a minimal decoder on top of a frozen [CLIP](clip) model for zero- and one-shot image segmentation."", ""It allows a computer to not only know what is in an image (classification), where objects are in the image (detection), but also what the outlines of those objects are. Knowing the outlines of objects is essential in fields such as robotics and autonomous driving. For example, a robot has to know the shape of an object to grab it correctly. Segmentation can also be combined with [image inpainting](https://t.co/5q8YHSOfx7) to allow users to describe which part of the image they want to replace. One limitation of most image segmentation models is that they only work with a fixed list of categories. For example, you cannot simply use a segmentation model trained on oranges to segment apples. To teach the segmentation model an additional category, you have to label data of the new category and train a new model, which can be costly and time-consuming. But what if there was a model that can already segment almost any kind of object, without any further training? That’s exactly what [CLIPSeg](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10003), a zero-shot segmentation model, achieves. Currently, CLIPSeg still has its limitations.""]","The CLIPSeg model uses images of 352 x 352 pixels, which results in relatively low-resolution outputs.",352 x 352 pixels
"What can you use Gradio for?
","[""Key Features\nLet's go through some of the key features of Gradio. This guide is intended to be a high-level overview of various things that you should be aware of as you build your demo. Where appropriate, we link to more detailed guides on specific topics. 1. [Components](#components)\n2. [Queuing](#queuing)\n3. [Streaming outputs](#streaming-outputs)\n4. [Streaming inputs](#streaming-inputs)\n5. [Alert modals](#alert-modals)\n6. [Styling](#styling)\n7. [Progress bars](#progress-bars)\n8. [Batch functions](#batch-functions)\n## Components\nGradio includes more than 30 pre-built components (as well as many user-built \\_custom components\\_) that can be used as inputs or outputs in your demo with a single line of code. These components correspond to common data types in machine learning and data science, e.g. the `gr.Image` component is designed to handle input or output images, the `gr.Label` component displays classification labels and probabilities, the `gr.Plot` component displays various kinds of plots, and so on. Each component includes various constructor attributes that control the properties of the component. For example, you can control the number of lines in a `gr.Textbox` using the `lines` argument (which takes a positive integer) in its constructor. Or you can control the way that a user can provide an image in the `gr.Image` component using the `sources` parameter (which takes a list like `[\""webcam\"", \""upload\""]`). \\*\\*Static and Interactive Components\\*\\*\nEvery component has a \\_static\\_ version that is designed to \\*display\\* data, and most components also have an \\_interactive\\_ version designed to let users input or modify the data. Typically, you don't need to think about this distinction, because when you build a Gradio demo, Gradio automatically figures out whether the component should be static or interactive based on whether it is being used as an input or output. However, you can set this manually using the `interactive` argument that every component supports. \\*\\*Preprocessing and Postprocessing\\*\\*\nWhen a component is used as an input, Gradio automatically handles the \\_preprocessing\\_ needed to convert the data from a type sent by the user's browser (such as an uploaded image) to a form that can be accepted by your function (such as a `numpy` array). Similarly, when a component is used as an output, Gradio automatically handles the \\_postprocessing\\_ needed to convert the data from what is returned by your function (such as a list of image paths) to a form that can be displayed in the user's browser (a gallery of images). Consider an example demo with three input components (`gr.Textbox`, `gr.Number`, and `gr.Image`) and two outputs (`gr.Number` and `gr.Gallery`) that serve as a UI for your image-to-image generation model. Below is a diagram of what our preprocessing will send to the model and what our postprocessing will require from it. ![](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/guides/assets/dataflow.svg?raw=true)\nIn this image, the following preprocessing steps happen to send the data from the browser to your function:\n\\* The text in the textbox is converted to a Python `str` (essentially no preprocessing)\n\\* The number in the number input in converted to a Python `float` (essentially no preprocessing)\n\\* Most importantly, ihe image supplied by the user is converted to a `numpy.array` representation of the RGB values in the image\nImages are converted to NumPy arrays because they are a common format for machine learning workflows. You can control the \\_preprocessing\\_ using the component's parameters when constructing the component. For example, if you instantiate the `Image` component with the following parameters, it will preprocess the image to the `PIL` format instead:\n```py\nimg = gr.Image(type=\""pil\"")\n```\nPostprocessing is even simpler! Gradio automatically recognizes the format of the returned data (e.g. does the user's function return a `numpy` array or a `str` filepath for the `gr.Image` component?) and postprocesses it appropriately into a format that can be displayed by the browser. So in the image above, the following postprocessing steps happen to send the data returned from a user's function to the browser:\n\\* The `float` is displayed as a number and displayed directly to the user\n\\* The list of string filepaths (`list[str]`) is interpreted as a list of image filepaths and displayed as a gallery in the browser\nTake a look at the [Docs](https://gradio.app/docs) to see all the parameters for each Gradio component."", ""### An Overview of Gradio\nSo far, we've been discussing the `Interface` class, which is a high-level class that lets to build demos quickly with Gradio. But what else does Gradio do? #### Chatbots with `gr.ChatInterface`\nGradio includes another high-level class, `gr.ChatInterface`, which is specifically designed to create Chatbot UIs. Similar to `Interface`, you supply a function and Gradio creates a fully working Chatbot UI. If you're interested in creating a chatbot, you can jump straight [our dedicated guide on `gr.ChatInterface`](https://www.gradio.app/guides/creating-a-chatbot-fast). #### Custom Demos with `gr.Blocks`\nGradio also offers a low-level approach for designing web apps with more flexible layouts and data flows with the `gr.Blocks` class. Blocks allows you to do things like control where components appear on the page, handle complex data flows (e.g. outputs can serve as inputs to other functions), and update properties/visibility of components based on user interaction — still all in Python. You can build very custom and complex applications using `gr.Blocks()`. For example, the popular image generation [Automatic1111 Web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) is built using Gradio Blocks. We dive deeper into the `gr.Blocks` on our series on [building with Blocks](https://www.gradio.app/guides/blocks-and-event-listeners). #### The Gradio Python & JavaScript Ecosystem\nThat's the gist of the core `gradio` Python library, but Gradio is actually so much more! Its an entire ecosystem of Python and JavaScript libraries that let you build machine learning applications, or query them programmatically, in Python or JavaScript. Here are other related parts of the Gradio ecosystem:\n\\* [Gradio Python Client](https://www.gradio.app/guides/getting-started-with-the-python-client) (`gradio\\_client`): query any Gradio app programmatically in Python. \\* [Gradio JavaScript Client](https://www.gradio.app/guides/getting-started-with-the-js-client) (`@gradio/client`): query any Gradio app programmatically in JavaScript. \\* [Gradio-Lite](https://www.gradio.app/guides/gradio-lite) (`@gradio/lite`): write Gradio apps in Python that run entirely in the browser (no server needed!), thanks to Pyodide. \\* [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces): the most popular place to host Gradio applications — for free!"", ""Gradio, check![[gradio-check]]\nThis wraps up the chapter on building cool ML demos with Gradio - we hope you enjoyed it! To recap, in this chapter we learned:\n- How to create Gradio demos with the high-level `Interface` API, and how to configure different input and output modalities. - Different ways to share Gradio demos, through temporary links and hosting on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces). - How to integrate Gradio demos with models and Spaces on the Hugging Face Hub. - Advanced features like storing state in a demo or providing authentication. - How to have full control of the data flow and layout of your demo with Gradio Blocks. If you'd like to test your understanding of the concepts covered in this chapter, check out the quiz in the next section! ## Where to next?[[where-to-next]]\nIf you want to learn more about Gradio you can\n- Take a look at [Demos](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/tree/main/demo) in the repo, there are quite a lot of examples there. - See the [Guides](https://gradio.app/guides/) page, where you can find guides about cool and advanced features.""]","Gradio can be used for a variety of purposes, primarily focused on building interactive machine learning demos and applications. Here are some key uses:

1. **Creating Demos**: You can quickly create demos for machine learning models using the `Interface` class, allowing users to interact with your models through a web interface.

2. **Chatbots**: With the `gr.ChatInterface`, you can build chatbot UIs that allow users to interact with conversational models easily.

3. **Custom Applications**: Using the `gr.Blocks` class, you can design more complex web applications with flexible layouts and data flows, enabling you to create custom and intricate applications.

4. **Integration with Models**: Gradio allows you to integrate your demos with models hosted on the Hugging Face Hub, making it easy to showcase your work.

5. **Sharing and Hosting**: You can share your Gradio demos through temporary links or host them on Hugging Face Spaces for free.

6. **Client Libraries**: Gradio provides Python and JavaScript client libraries that allow you to query Gradio apps programmatically.

Overall, Gradio is a powerful tool for anyone looking to create interactive interfaces for machine learning applications, making it accessible for users to test and explore models.","Create a demo for your machine learning model, share your machine learning model with others, and debug your model."

Typically, PyTorch model weights are saved or \\*pickled\\* into a `.bin` file with Python's [`pickle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) utility. However, `pickle` is not secure and pickled files may contain malicious code that can be executed. safetensors is a secure alternative to `pickle`, making it ideal for sharing model weights. This guide will show you how you load `.safetensor` files, and how to convert Stable Diffusion model weights stored in other formats to `.safetensor`. Before you start, make sure you have safetensors installed:\n```py\n# uncomment to install the necessary libraries in Colab\n#!pip install safetensors\n```\nIf you look at the [`runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5`](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5/tree/main) repository, you'll see weights inside the `text\\_encoder`, `unet` and `vae` subfolders are stored in the `.safetensors` format. By default, 🤗 Diffusers automatically loads these `.safetensors` files from their subfolders if they're available in the model repository. For more explicit control, you can optionally set `use\\_safetensors=True` (if `safetensors` is not installed, you'll get an error message asking you to install it):\n```py\nfrom diffusers import DiffusionPipeline\npipeline = DiffusionPipeline.from\\_pretrained(\""runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5\"", use\\_safetensors=True)\n```\nHowever, model weights are not necessarily stored in separate subfolders like in the example above. Sometimes, all the weights are stored in a single `.safetensors` file. In this case, if the weights are Stable Diffusion weights, you can load the file directly with the [`~diffusers.loaders.FromSingleFileMixin.from\\_single\\_file`] method:\n```py\nfrom diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline\npipeline = StableDiffusionPipeline.from\\_single\\_file(\n\""https://huggingface.co/WarriorMama777/OrangeMixs/blob/main/Models/AbyssOrangeMix/AbyssOrangeMix.safetensors\""\n)\n```\n## Convert to safetensors\nNot all weights on the Hub are available in the `.safetensors` format, and you may encounter weights stored as `.bin`."", ""!-- DISABLE-FRONTMATTER-SECTIONS -->\n\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/safetensors/safetensors-logo-light.svg)\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/safetensors/safetensors-logo-dark.svg)\n\n# Safetensors\nSafetensors is a new simple format for storing tensors safely (as opposed to pickle) and that is still fast (zero-copy).

Even though Transformers started with NLP, we support multiple modalities today, for example – vision, audio, vision-language, and Reinforcement Learning. For all of these modalities, all the corresponding models from Transformers enjoy some common benefits:\n- Easy model download with a single line of code with `from\\_pretrained()`\n- Easy model upload with `push\\_to\\_hub()`\n- Support for loading huge checkpoints with efficient checkpoint sharding techniques\n- Optimization support (with tools like [Optimum](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum))\n- Initialization from model configurations\n- Support for both PyTorch and TensorFlow (non-exhaustive)\n- and many more\nUnlike tokenizers, we have preprocessors (such as [this](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model\\_doc/vit#transformers.ViTImageProcessor)) that take care of preparing data for the vision models.

Payload:\n```js\npayload = {\n\""fromRepo\"" : \""namespace/repo\\_name\"",\n\""toRepo\"" : \""namespace2/repo\\_name2\"",\n\""type\"": \""model\"",\n}\n```\nThis is equivalent to `huggingface\\_hub.move\\_repo()`. ## User API\nThe following endpoint gets information about a user. ### GET /api/whoami-v2\nGet username and organizations the user belongs to. Payload:\n```js\nheaders = { \""authorization\"" : \""Bearer $token\"" }\n```\nThis is equivalent to `huggingface\\_hub.whoami()`."", ""Firstly, there are a few methods to manage repository creation, deletion, and others:\n```python no-format\nfrom huggingface\\_hub import (\n# User management\nlogin,\nlogout,\nwhoami,\n# Repository creation and management\ncreate\\_repo,\ndelete\\_repo,\nupdate\\_repo\\_visibility,\n# And some methods to retrieve/change information about the content\nlist\\_models,\nlist\\_datasets,\nlist\\_metrics,\nlist\\_repo\\_files,\nupload\\_file,\ndelete\\_file,\n)\n```\nAdditionally, it offers the very powerful `Repository` class to manage a local repository. We will explore these methods and that class in the next few section to understand how to leverage them. The `create\\_repo` method can be used to create a new repository on the hub:\n```py\nfrom huggingface\\_hub import create\\_repo\ncreate\\_repo(\""dummy-model\"")\n```\nThis will create the repository `dummy-model` in your namespace. If you like, you can specify which organization the repository should belong to using the `organization` argument:\n```py\nfrom huggingface\\_hub import create\\_repo\ncreate\\_repo(\""dummy-model\"",

存储库。[Git](https://git-scm.com/)是软件开发中广泛使用的工具，可以在协作工作时轻松对项目进行版本控制。本指南将向您展示如何与 Hub 上的存储库进行交互，特别关注以下内容：\n- 创建和删除存储库\n- 管理分支和标签\n- 重命名您的存储库\n- 更新您的存储库可见性\n- 管理存储库的本地副本\n如果您习惯于使用类似于GitLab/GitHub/Bitbucket等平台，您可能首先想到使用 `git`命令行工具来克隆存储库（`git clone`）、提交更改（`git add` , ` git commit`）并推送它们（`git push`）。在使用 Hugging Face Hub 时，这是有效的。然而，软件工程和机器学习并不具有相同的要求和工作流程。模型存储库可能会维护大量模型权重文件以适应不同的框架和工具，因此克隆存储库会导致您维护大量占用空间的本地文件夹。因此，使用我们的自定义HTTP方法可能更有效。您可以阅读我们的[git与HTTP相比较](../concepts/git\\_vs\\_http)解释页面以获取更多详细信息\n如果你想在Hub上创建和管理一个仓库，你的计算机必须处于登录状态。如果尚未登录，请参考[此部分](../quick-start#login)。在本指南的其余部分，我们将假设你的计算机已登录\n## 仓库创建和删除\n第一步是了解如何创建和删除仓库。你只能管理你拥有的仓库（在你的用户名命名空间下）或者你具有写入权限的组织中的仓库\n### 创建一个仓库\n使用 [`create\\_repo`] 创建一个空仓库，并通过 `repo\\_id`参数为其命名 `repo\\_id`是你的命名空间，后面跟着仓库名称：`username\\_or\\_org/repo\\_name`\n运行以下代码，以创建仓库：\n```py\n>>> from huggingface\\_hub import create\\_repo\n>>> create\\_repo(\""lysandre/test-model\"")\n'https://huggingface.co/lysandre/test-model'\n```\n默认情况下，[`create\\_repo`] 会创建一个模型仓库。但是你可以使用 `repo\\_type`参数来指定其他仓库类型。例如，如果你想创建一个数据集仓库\n请运行以下代码：\n```py\n>>> from huggingface\\_hub import create\\_repo\n>>> create\\_repo(\""lysandre/test-dataset\"", repo\\_type=\""dataset\"")\n'https://huggingface.co/datasets/lysandre/test-dataset'\n```\n创建仓库时，你可以使用 `private`参数设置仓库的可见性\n请运行以下代码\n```py\n>>> from huggingface\\_hub import create\\_repo\n>>> create\\_repo(\""lysandre/test-private\"", private=True)\n```\n如果你想在以后更改仓库的可见性，你可以使用[`update\\_repo\\_visibility`] 函数\n### 删除一个仓库\n使用 [`delete\\_repo`] 删除一个仓库。确保你确实想要删除仓库，因为这是一个不可逆转的过程！做完上述过程后，指定你想要删除的仓库的 `repo\\_id`\n请运行以下代码：\n```py\n>>> delete\\_repo(repo\\_id=\""lysandre/my-corrupted-dataset\"", repo\\_type=\""dataset\"")\n```\n### 克隆一个仓库（仅适用于 Spaces）\n在某些情况下，你可能想要复制别人的仓库并根据自己的用例进行调整。对于 Spaces，你可以使用 [`duplicate\\_space`] 方法来实现。它将复制整个仓库。\n你仍然需要配置自己的设置（硬件和密钥）。查看我们的[管理你的Space指南](./manage-spaces)以获取更多详细信息。\n请运行以下代码：\n```py\n>>> from huggingface\\_hub import duplicate\\_space\n>>> duplicate\\_space(\""multimodalart/dreambooth-training\"", private=False)\nRepoUrl('https://huggingface.co/spaces/nateraw/dreambooth-training',...)\n```\n## 上传和下载文件\n既然您已经创建了您的存储库，您现在也可以推送更改至其中并从中下载文件\n这两个主题有它们自己的指南。请[上传指南](./upload) 和[下载指南](./download)来学习如何使用您的存储库。\n## 分支和标签\nGit存储库通常使用分支来存储同一存储库的不同版本。标签也可以用于标记存储库的特定状态，例如，在发布版本这个情况下。更一般地说，分支和标签被称为[git引用](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References). ### 创建分支和标签\n你可以使用[`create\\_branch`]和[`create\\_tag`]来创建新的分支和标签:\n请运行以下代码：\n```py\n>>> from huggingface\\_hub import create\\_branch, create\\_tag\n# Create a branch on a Space repo from `main` branch\n>>> create\\_branch(\""Matthijs/speecht5-tts-demo\"", repo\\_type=\""space\"", branch=\""handle-dog-speaker\"")\n# Create a tag on a Dataset repo from `v0.1-release` branch\n>>> create\\_branch(\""bigcode/the-stack\"", repo\\_type=\""dataset\"", revision=\""v0.1-release\"", tag=\""v0.1.1\"", tag\\_message=\""Bump release version.\"")\n```\n同时,你可以以相同的方式使用 [`delete\\_branch`] 和 [`delete\\_tag`] 函数来删除分支或标签\n### 列出所有的分支和标签\n你还可以使用 [`list\\_repo\\_refs`] 列出存储库中的现有 Git 引用\n请运行以下代码：\n```py\n>>> from huggingface\\_hub import list\\_repo\\_refs\n>>> api.list\\_repo\\_refs(\""bigcode/the-stack\"", repo\\_type=\""dataset\"")\nGitRefs(\nbranches=[\nGitRefInfo(name='main', ref='refs/heads/main', target\\_commit='18edc1591d9ce72aa82f56c4431b3c969b210ae3'),\nGitRefInfo(name='v1.1.a1', ref='refs/heads/v1.1.a1', target\\_commit='f9826b862d1567f3822d3d25649b0d6d22ace714')\n],\nconverts=[],\ntags=[\nGitRefInfo(name='v1.0', ref='refs/tags/v1.0', target\\_commit='c37a8cd1e382064d8aced5e05543c5f7753834da')\n]\n)\n```\n## 修改存储库设置\n存储库具有一些可配置的设置。大多数情况下，您通常会在浏览器中的存储库设置页面上手动配置这些设置。要配置存储库，您必须具有对其的写访问权限（拥有它或属于组织）。在本节中，我们将看到您还可以使用 `huggingface\\_hub` 在编程方式上配置的设置。\n一些设置是特定于 Spaces（硬件、环境变量等）的。要配置这些设置，请参考我们的[管理Spaces](../guides/manage-spaces)指南。\n### 更新可见性\n一个存储库可以是公共的或私有的。私有存储库仅对您或存储库所在组织的成员可见。\n请运行以下代码将存储库更改为私有：\n```py\n>>> from huggingface\\_hub import update\\_repo\\_visibility\n>>> update\\_repo\\_visibility(repo\\_id=repo\\_id, private=True)\n```\n### 重命名您的存储库\n您可以使用 [`move\\_repo`] 在 Hub 上重命名您的存储库。使用这种方法，您还可以将存储库从一个用户移动到一个组织。在这样做时，有一些[限制](https://hf.co/docs/hub/repositories-settings#renaming-or-transferring-a-repo)需要注意。例如，您不能将存储库转移到另一个用户。\n请运行以下代码：\n```py\n>>> from huggingface\\_hub import move\\_repo\n>>> move\\_repo(from\\_id=\""Wauplin/cool-model\"", to\\_id=\""huggingface/cool-model\"")\n```\n## 管理存储库的本地副本\n上述所有操作都可以通过HTTP请求完成。然而，在某些情况下，您可能希望在本地拥有存储库的副本，并使用您熟悉的Git命令与之交互。\n[`Repository`] 类允许您使用类似于Git命令的函数与Hub上的文件和存储库进行交互。它是对Git和Git-LFS方法的包装，以使用您已经了解和喜爱的Git命令。在开始之前，请确保已安装Git-LFS（请参阅[此处](https://git-lfs.github.com/)获取安装说明）。\n### 使用本地存储库\n使用本地存储库路径实例化一个 [`Repository`] 对象：\n请运行以下代码：\n```py\n>>> from huggingface\\_hub import Repository\n>>> repo = Repository(local\\_dir=\""//\"")\n```\n### 克隆\n`clone\\_from`参数将一个存储库从Hugging Face存储库ID克隆到由 `local\\_dir`参数指定的本地目录：\n请运行以下代码：\n```py\n>>> from huggingface\\_hub import Repository\n>>> repo = Repository(local\\_dir=\""w2v2\"", clone\\_from=\""facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60\"")\n```\n`clone\\_from`还可以使用URL克隆存储库：\n请运行以下代码：\n```py\n>>> repo = Repository(local\\_dir=\""huggingface-hub\"", clone\\_from=\""https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60\"")\n```\n你可以将`clone\\_from`参数与[`create\\_repo`]结合使用，以创建并克隆一个存储库：\n请运行以下代码：\n```py\n>>> repo\\_url = create\\_repo(repo\\_id=\""repo\\_name\"")\n>>> repo = Repository(local\\_dir=\""repo\\_local\\_path\"", clone\\_from=repo\\_url)\n```\n当你克隆一个存储库时，通过在克隆时指定`git\\_user`和`git\\_email`参数，你还可以为克隆的存储库配置Git用户名和电子邮件。当用户提交到该存储库时，Git将知道提交的作者是谁。\n请运行以下代码：\n```py\n>>> repo = Repository(\n...""]",The default repository type created by the `create_repo` function on Hugging Face Hub is a model repository.,model
"How many splits does the ""duorc"" dataset have?
","[""List splits and configurations\nDatasets typically have splits and may also have configurations. A \\_split\\_ is a subset of the dataset, like `train` and `test`, that are used during different stages of training and evaluating a model. A \\_configuration\\_ is a sub-dataset contained within a larger dataset. Configurations are especially common in multilingual speech datasets where there may be a different configuration for each language. If you're interested in learning more about splits and configurations, check out the [Load a dataset from the Hub tutorial](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/main/en/load\\_hub)!

Unlike [DistributedDataParallel (DDP)](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel.html), FSDP reduces memory-usage because a model is replicated on each GPU. This improves GPU memory-efficiency and allows you to train much larger models on fewer GPUs. FSDP is integrated with the Accelerate, a library for easily managing training in distributed environments, which means it is available for use from the [`Trainer`] class. Before you start, make sure Accelerate is installed and at least PyTorch 2.1.0 or newer. ```bash\npip install accelerate\n```\n## FSDP configuration\nTo start, run the [`accelerate config`](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/package\\_reference/cli#accelerate-config) command to create a configuration file for your training environment. Accelerate uses this configuration file to automatically setup the correct training environment based on your selected training options in `accelerate config`. ```bash\naccelerate config\n```\nWhen you run `accelerate config`, you'll be prompted with a series of options to configure your training environment."", ""This section covers some of the most important FSDP options. To learn more about the other available FSDP options, take a look at the [fsdp\\_config](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main\\_classes/trainer#transformers.TrainingArguments.fsdp\\_config) parameters. ### Sharding strategy\nFSDP offers a number of sharding strategies to select from:\n\\* `FULL\\_SHARD` - shards model parameters, gradients and optimizer states across workers; select `1` for this option\n\\* `SHARD\\_GRAD\\_OP`- shard gradients and optimizer states across workers; select `2` for this option\n\\* `NO\\_SHARD` - don't shard anything (this is equivalent to DDP); select `3` for this option\n\\* `HYBRID\\_SHARD` - shard model parameters, gradients and optimizer states within each worker where each worker also has a full copy; select `4` for this option\n\\* `HYBRID\\_SHARD\\_ZERO2` - shard gradients and optimizer states within each worker where each worker also has a full copy; select `5` for this option\nThis is enabled by the `fsdp\\_sharding\\_strategy` flag."", ""By sharding the model parameters, optimizer and gradient states, and even offloading them to the CPU when they're inactive, FSDP can reduce the high cost of large-scale training. If you're interested in learning more, the following may be helpful:\n\\* Follow along with the more in-depth Accelerate guide for [FSDP](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/usage\\_guides/fsdp). \\* Read the [Introducing PyTorch Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) API](https://pytorch.org/blog/introducing-pytorch-fully-sharded-data-parallel-api/) blog post. \\* Read the [Scaling PyTorch models on Cloud TPUs with FSDP](https://pytorch.org/blog/scaling-pytorch-models-on-cloud-tpus-with-fsdp/) blog post.""]","Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) is a data parallel method designed to optimize memory usage during distributed training by sharding a model's parameters, gradients, and optimizer states across the available GPUs (workers). The main purposes of FSDP are:

1. **Memory Efficiency**: By sharding the model components, FSDP reduces the memory footprint on each GPU, allowing for the training of larger models on fewer GPUs compared to traditional methods like DistributedDataParallel (DDP), which replicates the entire model on each GPU.

2. **Scalability**: FSDP enables the training of very large models that would otherwise not fit into the memory of a single GPU, making it suitable for scaling up deep learning tasks.

3. **Integration with Accelerate**: FSDP is integrated with the Accelerate library, which simplifies the management of training in distributed environments, making it easier for users to set up and configure their training processes.

Overall, FSDP enhances the efficiency and scalability of distributed training, making it a valuable tool for deep learning practitioners.","FSDP is developed for distributed training of large pretrained models up to 1T parameters by sharding the model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states across data parallel processes."
"What file format is used to save and store PyTorch model weights more securely than `.bin` files?
","[""We are also taking steps to make sure the existing PyTorch files are not malicious, but the best we can do is flag suspicious-looking files.

The easiest way to convert your model weights is to use the [Convert Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/diffusers/convert), given your model weights are already stored on the Hub. The Convert Space downloads the pickled weights, converts them, and opens a Pull Request to upload the newly converted `.safetensors` file to your repository. For larger models, the Space may be a bit slower because its resources are tied up in converting other models. You can also try running the [convert.py](https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors/blob/main/bindings/python/convert.py) script (this is what the Space is running) locally to convert your weights. Feel free to ping [@Narsil](https://huggingface.co/Narsil) for any issues with the Space."", ""On CPU, if the file is already in cache, then it can\ntruly be zero-copy, whereas on GPU there is not such disk cache, so a copy is always required\nbut you can bypass allocating all the tensors on CPU at any given point. SafeTensors is not zero-copy for the header. The choice of JSON is pretty arbitrary, but since deserialization is <<< of the time required to load the actual tensor data and is readable I went that way, (also space is <<< to the tensor data). - Endianness: Little-endian. This can be modified later, but it feels really unnecessary at the\nmoment. - Order: 'C' or row-major. This seems to have won. We can add that information later if needed. - Stride: No striding, all tensors need to be packed before being serialized. I have yet to see a case where it seems useful to have a strided tensor stored in serialized format. ### Benefits\nSince we can invent a new format we can propose additional benefits:\n- Prevent DOS attacks: We can craft the format in such a way that it's almost\nimpossible to use malicious files to DOS attack a user. Currently, there's a limit\non the size of the header of 100MB to prevent parsing extremely large JSON. Also when reading the file, there's a guarantee that addresses in the file\ndo not overlap in any way, meaning when you're loading a file you should never\nexceed the size of the file in memory\n- Faster load: PyTorch seems to be the fastest file to load out in the major\nML formats. However, it does seem to have an extra copy on CPU, which we\ncan bypass in this lib by using `torch.UntypedStorage.from\\_file`. Currently, CPU loading times are extremely fast with this lib compared to pickle. GPU loading times are as fast or faster than PyTorch equivalent. Loading first on CPU with memmapping with torch, and then moving all tensors to GPU seems\nto be faster too somehow (similar behavior in torch pickle)\n- Lazy loading: in distributed (multi-node or multi-gpu) settings, it's nice to be able to\nload only part of the tensors on the various models. For\n[BLOOM](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom) using this format enabled\nto load the model on 8 GPUs from 10mn with regular PyTorch weights down to 45s.""]",The file format used to save and store PyTorch model weights more securely than `.bin` files is the `safetensors` format.,`.safetensors`

MarkupLM is BERT, but\napplied to HTML pages instead of raw text documents. The model incorporates additional embedding layers to improve\nperformance, similar to [LayoutLM](layoutlm). The model can be used for tasks like question answering on web pages or information extraction from web pages. It obtains\nstate-of-the-art results on 2 important benchmarks:\n- [WebSRC](https://x-lance.github.io/WebSRC/), a dataset for Web-Based Structural Reading Comprehension (a bit like SQuAD but for web pages)\n- [SWDE](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221299838\\_From\\_one\\_tree\\_to\\_a\\_forest\\_a\\_unified\\_solution\\_for\\_structured\\_web\\_data\\_extraction), a dataset\nfor information extraction from web pages (basically named-entity recogntion on web pages)\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:\n\\*Multimodal pre-training with text, layout, and image has made significant progress for Visually-rich Document\nUnderstanding (VrDU), especially the fixed-layout documents such as scanned document images. While, there are still a\nlarge number of digital documents where the layout information is not fixed and needs to be interactively and\ndynamically rendered for visualization, making existing layout-based pre-training approaches not easy to apply. In this\npaper, we propose MarkupLM for document understanding tasks with markup languages as the backbone such as\nHTML/XML-based documents, where text and markup information is jointly pre-trained. Experiment results show that the\npre-trained MarkupLM significantly outperforms the existing strong baseline models on several document understanding\ntasks. The pre-trained model and code will be publicly available.\\*\nThis model was contributed by [nielsr](https://huggingface.co/nielsr). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/markuplm). ## Usage tips\n- In addition to `input\\_ids`, [`~MarkupLMModel.forward`] expects 2 additional inputs, namely `xpath\\_tags\\_seq` and `xpath\\_subs\\_seq`. These are the XPATH tags and subscripts respectively for each token in the input sequence. - One can use [`MarkupLMProcessor`] to prepare all data for the model. Refer to the [usage guide](#usage-markuplmprocessor) for more info. ![drawing](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/model_doc/markuplm_architecture.jpg)\n MarkupLM architecture. Taken from the [original paper.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08518) \n## Usage: MarkupLMProcessor\nThe easiest way to prepare data for the model is to use [`MarkupLMProcessor`], which internally combines a feature extractor\n([`MarkupLMFeatureExtractor`]) and a tokenizer ([`MarkupLMTokenizer`] or [`MarkupLMTokenizerFast`]). The feature extractor is\nused to extract all nodes and xpaths from the HTML strings, which are then provided to the tokenizer, which turns them into the\ntoken-level inputs of the model (`input\\_ids` etc.). Note that you can still use the feature extractor and tokenizer separately,\nif you only want to handle one of the two tasks. ```python\nfrom transformers import MarkupLMFeatureExtractor, MarkupLMTokenizerFast, MarkupLMProcessor\nfeature\\_extractor = MarkupLMFeatureExtractor()\ntokenizer = MarkupLMTokenizerFast.from\\_pretrained(\""microsoft/markuplm-base\"")\nprocessor = MarkupLMProcessor(feature\\_extractor, tokenizer)\n```\nIn short, one can provide HTML strings (and possibly additional data) to [`MarkupLMProcessor`],\nand it will create the inputs expected by the model. Internally, the processor first uses\n[`MarkupLMFeatureExtractor`] to get a list of nodes and corresponding xpaths. The nodes and\nxpaths are then provided to [`MarkupLMTokenizer`] or [`MarkupLMTokenizerFast`], which converts them\nto token-level `input\\_ids`, `attention\\_mask`, `token\\_type\\_ids`, `xpath\\_subs\\_seq`, `xpath\\_tags\\_seq`. Optionally, one can provide node labels to the processor, which are turned into token-level `labels`. [`MarkupLMFeatureExtractor`] uses [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/), a Python library for\npulling data out of HTML and XML files, under the hood. Note that you can still use your own parsing solution of\nchoice, and provide the nodes and xpaths yourself to [`MarkupLMTokenizer`] or [`MarkupLMTokenizerFast`]."", ""!--Copyright 2023 The HuggingFace Team.

Encoding text as a sequence of tokens requires a tokenizer, which is typically created as an independent artifact from\nthe model. Token-free models that instead operate directly on raw text (bytes or characters) have many benefits: they\ncan process text in any language out of the box, they are more robust to noise, and they minimize technical debt by\nremoving complex and error-prone text preprocessing pipelines. Since byte or character sequences are longer than token\nsequences, past work on token-free models has often introduced new model architectures designed to amortize the cost of\noperating directly on raw text. In this paper, we show that a standard Transformer architecture can be used with\nminimal modifications to process byte sequences. We carefully characterize the trade-offs in terms of parameter count,\ntraining FLOPs, and inference speed, and show that byte-level models are competitive with their token-level\ncounterparts. We also demonstrate that byte-level models are significantly more robust to noise and perform better on\ntasks that are sensitive to spelling and pronunciation. As part of our contribution, we release a new set of\npre-trained byte-level Transformer models based on the T5 architecture, as well as all code and data used in our\nexperiments.\\*\nThis model was contributed by [patrickvonplaten](https://huggingface.co/patrickvonplaten). The original code can be\nfound [here](https://github.com/google-research/byt5). ByT5's architecture is based on the T5v1.1 model, refer to [T5v1.1's documentation page](t5v1.1) for the API reference. They\nonly differ in how inputs should be prepared for the model, see the code examples below. Since ByT5 was pre-trained unsupervisedly, there's no real advantage to using a task prefix during single-task\nfine-tuning. If you are doing multi-task fine-tuning, you should use a prefix. ## Usage example\nByT5 works on raw UTF-8 bytes, so it can be used without a tokenizer:\n```python\n>>> from transformers import T5ForConditionalGeneration\n>>> import torch\n>>> model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from\\_pretrained(\""google/byt5-small\"")\n>>> num\\_special\\_tokens = 3\n>>> # Model has 3 special tokens which take up the input ids 0,1,2 of ByT5. >>> # => Need to shift utf-8 character encodings by 3 before passing ids to model. >>> input\\_ids = torch.tensor([list(\""Life is like a box of chocolates.\"".encode(\""utf-8\""))]) + num\\_special\\_tokens\n>>> labels = torch.tensor([list(\""La vie est comme une boîte de chocolat.\"".encode(\""utf-8\""))]) + num\\_special\\_tokens\n>>> loss = model(input\\_ids, labels=labels).loss\n>>> loss.item()\n2.66\n```\nFor batched inference and training it is however recommended to make use of the tokenizer:\n```python\n>>> from transformers import T5ForConditionalGeneration, AutoTokenizer\n>>> model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from\\_pretrained(\""google/byt5-small\"")\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from\\_pretrained(\""google/byt5-small\"")\n>>> model\\_inputs = tokenizer(\n...

"What is the dimension of the feature vector for the base BERT model?
","[""n this video, we'll study the encoder architecture. An example of a popular encoder-only architecture is BERT, which is the most popular model of its kind. Let's first start by understanding how it works. We'll use a small example, using three words. We use these as inputs, and pass them through the encoder. We retrieve a numerical representation of each word. Here, for example, the encoder converts the three words “Welcome to NYC” in these three sequences of numbers. The encoder outputs exactly one sequence of numbers per input word. This numerical representation can also be called a \""Feature vector\"", or \""Feature tensor\"". Let's dive in this representation. It contains one vector per word that was passed through the encoder. Each of these vector is a numerical representation of the word in question. The dimension of that vector is defined by the architecture of the model, for the base BERT model, it is 768. These representations contain the value of a word; but contextualized. For example, the vector attributed to the word \""to\"", isn't the representation of only the \""to\"" word. It also takes into account the words around it, which we call the “context”.As in, it looks to the left context, the word on the left of the one we're studying (here the word \""Welcome\"") and the context on the right (here the word \""NYC\"") and outputs a value for the word, within its context. It is therefore a contextualized value. One could say that the vector of 768 values holds the \""meaning\"" of that word in the text. How it does this is thanks to the self-attention mechanism. The self-attention mechanism relates to different positions (or different words) in a single sequence, in order to compute a representation of that sequence."", ""!--Copyright 2020 The HuggingFace Team.

It's a\nbidirectional transformer pretrained using a combination of masked language modeling objective and next sentence\nprediction on a large corpus comprising the Toronto Book Corpus and Wikipedia. The abstract from the paper is the following:\n\\*We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations\nfrom Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional\nrepresentations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result,\nthe pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models\nfor a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific\narchitecture modifications.\\*\n\\*BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural\nlanguage processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI\naccuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute\nimprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).\\*\nThis model was contributed by [thomwolf](https://huggingface.co/thomwolf)."", ""---\n## 2. How does BERT Work? BERT works by leveraging the following:\n### 2.1 Large amounts of training data\nA massive dataset of 3.3 Billion words has contributed to BERT’s continued success. BERT was specifically trained on Wikipedia (\\~2.5B words) and Google’s BooksCorpus (\\~800M words). These large informational datasets contributed to BERT’s deep knowledge not only of the English language but also of our world! 🚀\nTraining on a dataset this large takes a long time. BERT’s training was made possible thanks to the novel Transformer architecture and sped up by using TPUs (Tensor Processing Units - Google’s custom circuit built specifically for large ML models). —64 TPUs trained BERT over the course of 4 days. \\*\\*Note:\\*\\* Demand for smaller BERT models is increasing in order to use BERT within smaller computational environments (like cell phones and personal computers). [23 smaller BERT models were released in March 2020](https://github.com/google-research/bert). [DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model\\_doc/distilbert) offers a lighter version of BERT; runs 60% faster while maintaining over 95% of BERT’s performance. ### 2.2 What is a Masked Language Model? MLM enables/enforces bidirectional learning from text by masking (hiding) a word in a sentence and forcing BERT to bidirectionally use the words on either side of the covered word to predict the masked word.""]",The dimension of the feature vector for the base BERT model is 768.,768
"What special identifier does the WordPiece Model use for continuing subwords?
","[""WordPiece tokenization[[wordpiece-tokenization]]\nWordPiece is the tokenization algorithm Google developed to pretrain BERT. It has since been reused in quite a few Transformer models based on BERT, such as DistilBERT, MobileBERT, Funnel Transformers, and MPNET. It's very similar to BPE in terms of the training, but the actual tokenization is done differently. 💡 This section covers WordPiece in depth, going as far as showing a full implementation. You can skip to the end if you just want a general overview of the tokenization algorithm. ## Training algorithm[[training-algorithm]]\n⚠️ Google never open-sourced its implementation of the training algorithm of WordPiece, so what follows is our best guess based on the published literature. It may not be 100% accurate. Like BPE, WordPiece starts from a small vocabulary including the special tokens used by the model and the initial alphabet. Since it identifies subwords by adding a prefix (like `##` for BERT), each word is initially split by adding that prefix to all the characters inside the word. So, for instance, `\""word\""` gets split like this:\n```\nw ##o ##r ##d\n```\nThus, the initial alphabet contains all the characters present at the beginning of a word and the characters present inside a word preceded by the WordPiece prefix. Then, again like BPE, WordPiece learns merge rules. The main difference is the way the pair to be merged is selected. Instead of selecting the most frequent pair, WordPiece computes a score for each pair, using the following formula:\n$$\\mathrm{score} = (\\mathrm{freq\\\\_of\\\\_pair}) / (\\mathrm{freq\\\\_of\\\\_first\\\\_element} \\times \\mathrm{freq\\\\_of\\\\_second\\\\_element})$$\nBy dividing the frequency of the pair by the product of the frequencies of each of its parts, the algorithm prioritizes the merging of pairs where the individual parts are less frequent in the vocabulary."", ""For instance,\nthe word `\""bug\""` would be tokenized to `[\""b\"", \""ug\""]` but `\""mug\""` would be tokenized as `[\""\"", \""ug\""]` since\nthe symbol `\""m\""` is not in the base vocabulary. In general, single letters such as `\""m\""` are not replaced by the\n`\""\""` symbol because the training data usually includes at least one occurrence of each letter, but it is likely\nto happen for very special characters like emojis. As mentioned earlier, the vocabulary size, \\*i.e.\\* the base vocabulary size + the number of merges, is a hyperparameter\nto choose. For instance [GPT](model\\_doc/gpt) has a vocabulary size of 40,478 since they have 478 base characters\nand chose to stop training after 40,000 merges. #### Byte-level BPE\nA base vocabulary that includes all possible base characters can be quite large if \\*e.g.\\* all unicode characters are\nconsidered as base characters. To have a better base vocabulary, [GPT-2](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language\\_models\\_are\\_unsupervised\\_multitask\\_learners.pdf) uses bytes\nas the base vocabulary, which is a clever trick to force the base vocabulary to be of size 256 while ensuring that\nevery base character is included in the vocabulary. With some additional rules to deal with punctuation, the GPT2's\ntokenizer can tokenize every text without the need for the  symbol. [GPT-2](model\\_doc/gpt) has a vocabulary\nsize of 50,257, which corresponds to the 256 bytes base tokens, a special end-of-text token and the symbols learned\nwith 50,000 merges. ### WordPiece\nWordPiece is the subword tokenization algorithm used for [BERT](model\\_doc/bert), [DistilBERT](model\\_doc/distilbert), and [Electra](model\\_doc/electra). The algorithm was outlined in [Japanese and Korean\nVoice Search (Schuster et al., 2012)](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/ja//pubs/archive/37842.pdf) and is very similar to\nBPE. WordPiece first initializes the vocabulary to include every character present in the training data and\nprogressively learns a given number of merge rules. In contrast to BPE, WordPiece does not choose the most frequent\nsymbol pair, but the one that maximizes the likelihood of the training data once added to the vocabulary. So what does this mean exactly? Referring to the previous example, maximizing the likelihood of the training data is\nequivalent to finding the symbol pair, whose probability divided by the probabilities of its first symbol followed by\nits second symbol is the greatest among all symbol pairs. \\*E.g.\\* `\""u\""`, followed by `\""g\""` would have only been\nmerged if the probability of `\""ug\""` divided by `\""u\""`, `\""g\""` would have been greater than for any other symbol\npair. Intuitively, WordPiece is slightly different to BPE in that it evaluates what it \\_loses\\_ by merging two symbols\nto ensure it's \\_worth it\\_. ### Unigram\nUnigram is a subword tokenization algorithm introduced in [Subword Regularization: Improving Neural Network Translation\nModels with Multiple Subword Candidates (Kudo, 2018)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.10959.pdf). In contrast to BPE or\nWordPiece, Unigram initializes its base vocabulary to a large number of symbols and progressively trims down each\nsymbol to obtain a smaller vocabulary. The base vocabulary could for instance correspond to all pre-tokenized words and\nthe most common substrings. Unigram is not used directly for any of the models in the transformers, but it's used in\nconjunction with [SentencePiece](#sentencepiece). At each training step, the Unigram algorithm defines a loss (often defined as the log-likelihood) over the training\ndata given the current vocabulary and a unigram language model. Then, for each symbol in the vocabulary, the algorithm\ncomputes how much the overall loss would increase if the symbol was to be removed from the vocabulary. Unigram then\nremoves p (with p usually being 10% or 20%) percent of the symbols whose loss increase is the lowest, \\*i.e.\\* those\nsymbols that least affect the overall loss over the training data. This process is repeated until the vocabulary has\nreached the desired size. The Unigram algorithm always keeps the base characters so that any word can be tokenized. Because Unigram is not based on merge rules (in contrast to BPE and WordPiece), the algorithm has several ways of\ntokenizing new text after training. As an example, if a trained Unigram tokenizer exhibits the vocabulary:\n```\n[\""b\"", \""g\"", \""h\"", \""n\"", \""p\"", \""s\"", \""u\"", \""ug\"", \""un\"", \""hug\""],\n```\n`\""hugs\""` could be tokenized both as `[\""hug\"", \""s\""]`, `[\""h\"", \""ug\"", \""s\""]` or `[\""h\"", \""u\"", \""g\"", \""s\""]`. So which one\nto choose? Unigram saves the probability of each token in the training corpus on top of saving the vocabulary so that\nthe probability of each possible tokenization can be computed after training."", ""We can see that the words `[\""i\"", \""have\"", \""a\"", \""new\""]` are present in the tokenizer's vocabulary, but the word `\""gpu\""` is not. Consequently, the\ntokenizer splits `\""gpu\""` into known subwords: `[\""gp\"" and \""##u\""]`. `\""##\""` means that the rest of the token should\nbe attached to the previous one, without space (for decoding or reversal of the tokenization). As another example, [`~transformers.XLNetTokenizer`] tokenizes our previously exemplary text as follows:\n```py\n>>> from transformers import XLNetTokenizer\n>>> tokenizer = XLNetTokenizer.from\\_pretrained(\""xlnet-base-cased\"")\n>>> tokenizer.tokenize(\""Don't you love 🤗 Transformers? We sure do.\"")\n[\""▁Don\"", \""'\"", \""t\"", \""▁you\"", \""▁love\"", \""▁\"", \""🤗\"", \""▁\"", \""Transform\"", \""ers\"", \""?\"", \""▁We\"", \""▁sure\"", \""▁do\"", \"".\""]\n```\nWe'll get back to the meaning of those `\""▁\""` when we look at [SentencePiece](#sentencepiece). As one can see,\nthe rare word `\""Transformers\""` has been split into the more frequent subwords `\""Transform\""` and `\""ers\""`. Let's now look at how the different subword tokenization algorithms work. Note that all of those tokenization\nalgorithms rely on some form of training which is usually done on the corpus the corresponding model will be trained\non. ### Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)\nByte-Pair Encoding (BPE) was introduced in [Neural Machine Translation of Rare Words with Subword Units (Sennrich et\nal., 2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07909).""]","The WordPiece model uses the prefix `##` to indicate continuing subwords. For example, if a word is split into subwords, the subwords will be prefixed with `##` to show that they are part of the same word.",##

"What is the default setting for the `allow_flagging` parameter in Gradio's `Interface`?
","[""Using Flagging\nRelated spaces: https://huggingface.co/spaces/gradio/calculator-flagging-crowdsourced, https://huggingface.co/spaces/gradio/calculator-flagging-options, https://huggingface.co/spaces/gradio/calculator-flag-basic\nTags: FLAGGING, DATA\n## Introduction\nWhen you demo a machine learning model, you might want to collect data from users who try the model, particularly data points in which the model is not behaving as expected. Capturing these \""hard\"" data points is valuable because it allows you to improve your machine learning model and make it more reliable and robust. Gradio simplifies the collection of this data by including a \\*\\*Flag\\*\\* button with every `Interface`. This allows a user or tester to easily send data back to the machine where the demo is running. In this Guide, we discuss more about how to use the flagging feature, both with `gradio.Interface` as well as with `gradio.Blocks`. ## The \\*\\*Flag\\*\\* button in `gradio.Interface`\nFlagging with Gradio's `Interface` is especially easy. By default, underneath the output components, there is a button marked \\*\\*Flag\\*\\*. When a user testing your model sees input with interesting output, they can click the flag button to send the input and output data back to the machine where the demo is running. The sample is saved to a CSV log file (by default). If the demo involves images, audio, video, or other types of files, these are saved separately in a parallel directory and the paths to these files are saved in the CSV file. There are [four parameters](https://gradio.app/docs/#interface-header) in `gradio.Interface` that control how flagging works. We will go over them in greater detail. - `allow\\_flagging`: this parameter can be set to either `\""manual\""` (default), `\""auto\""`, or `\""never\""`. - `manual`: users will see a button to flag, and samples are only flagged when the button is clicked. - `auto`: users will not see a button to flag, but every sample will be flagged automatically. - `never`: users will not see a button to flag, and no sample will be flagged. - `flagging\\_options`: this parameter can be either `None` (default) or a list of strings. - If `None`, then the user simply clicks on the \\*\\*Flag\\*\\* button and no additional options are shown. - If a list of strings are provided, then the user sees several buttons, corresponding to each of the strings that are provided. For example, if the value of this parameter is `[\""Incorrect\"", \""Ambiguous\""]`, then buttons labeled \\*\\*Flag as Incorrect\\*\\* and \\*\\*Flag as Ambiguous\\*\\* appear. This only applies if `allow\\_flagging` is `\""manual\""`. - The chosen option is then logged along with the input and output. - `flagging\\_dir`: this parameter takes a string. - It represents what to name the directory where flagged data is stored. - `flagging\\_callback`: this parameter takes an instance of a subclass of the `FlaggingCallback` class\n- Using this parameter allows you to write custom code that gets run when the flag button is clicked\n- By default, this is set to an instance of `gr.CSVLogger`\n- One example is setting it to an instance of `gr.HuggingFaceDatasetSaver` which can allow you to pipe any flagged data into a HuggingFace Dataset."", ""- `description`: which accepts text, markdown or HTML and places it right under the title. - `article`: which also accepts text, markdown or HTML and places it below the interface. ![annotated](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/guides/assets/annotated.png?raw=true)\nIf you're using the `Blocks` API instead, you can insert text, markdown, or HTML anywhere using the `gr.Markdown(...)` or `gr.HTML(...)` components, with descriptive content inside the `Component` constructor. Another useful keyword argument is `label=`, which is present in every `Component`. This modifies the label text at the top of each `Component`. You can also add the `info=` keyword argument to form elements like `Textbox` or `Radio` to provide further information on their usage. ```python\ngr.Number(label='Age', info='In years, must be greater than 0')\n```\n## Flagging\nBy default, an `Interface` will have \""Flag\"" button. When a user testing your `Interface` sees input with interesting output, such as erroneous or unexpected model behaviour, they can flag the input for you to review. Within the directory provided by the `flagging\\_dir=` argument to the `Interface` constructor, a CSV file will log the flagged inputs. If the interface involves file data, such as for Image and Audio components, folders will be created to store those flagged data as well. For example, with the calculator interface shown above, we would have the flagged data stored in the flagged directory shown below:\n```directory\n+-- calculator.py\n+-- flagged/\n| +-- logs.csv\n```\n\\_flagged/logs.csv\\_\n```csv\nnum1,operation,num2,Output\n5,add,7,12\n6,subtract,1.5,4.5\n```\nWith the sepia interface shown earlier, we would have the flagged data stored in the flagged directory shown below:\n```directory\n+-- sepia.py\n+-- flagged/\n| +-- logs.csv\n| +-- im/\n| | +-- 0.png\n| | +-- 1.png\n| +-- Output/\n| | +-- 0.png\n| | +-- 1.png\n```\n\\_flagged/logs.csv\\_\n```csv\nim,Output\nim/0.png,Output/0.png\nim/1.png,Output/1.png\n```\nIf you wish for the user to provide a reason for flagging, you can pass a list of strings to the `flagging\\_options` argument of Interface. Users will have to select one of the strings when flagging, which will be saved as an additional column to the CSV."", ""(See more below.)\n## What happens to flagged data? Within the directory provided by the `flagging\\_dir` argument, a CSV file will log the flagged data. Here's an example: The code below creates the calculator interface embedded below it:\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\ndef calculator(num1, operation, num2):\nif operation == \""add\"":\nreturn num1 + num2\nelif operation == \""subtract\"":\nreturn num1 - num2\nelif operation == \""multiply\"":\nreturn num1 \\* num2\nelif operation == \""divide\"":\nreturn num1 / num2\niface = gr.Interface(\ncalculator,\n[\""number\"", gr.Radio([\""add\"", \""subtract\"", \""multiply\"", \""divide\""]), \""number\""],\n\""number\"",\nallow\\_flagging=\""manual\""\n)\niface.launch()\n```\nWhen you click the flag button above, the directory where the interface was launched will include a new flagged subfolder, with a csv file inside it. This csv file includes all the data that was flagged. ```directory\n+-- flagged/\n| +-- logs.csv\n```\n\\_flagged/logs.csv\\_\n```csv\nnum1,operation,num2,Output,timestamp\n5,add,7,12,2022-01-31 11:40:51.093412\n6,subtract,1.5,4.5,2022-01-31 03:25:32.023542\n```\nIf the interface involves file data, such as for Image and Audio components, folders will be created to store those flagged data as well. For example an `image` input to `image` output interface will create the following structure. ```directory\n+-- flagged/\n| +-- logs.csv\n| +-- image/\n| | +-- 0.png\n| | +-- 1.png\n| +-- Output/\n| | +-- 0.png\n| | +-- 1.png\n```\n\\_flagged/logs.csv\\_\n```csv\nim,Output timestamp\nim/0.png,Output/0.png,2022-02-04 19:49:58.026963\nim/1.png,Output/1.png,2022-02-02 10:40:51.093412\n```\nIf you wish for the user to provide a reason for flagging, you can pass a list of strings to the `flagging\\_options` argument of Interface. Users will have to select one of these choices when flagging, and the option will be saved as an additional column to the CSV. If we go back to the calculator example, the following code will create the interface embedded below it. ```python\niface = gr.Interface(\ncalculator,\n[\""number\"", gr.Radio([\""add\"", \""subtract\"", \""multiply\"", \""divide\""]), \""number\""],\n\""number\"",\nallow\\_flagging=\""manual\"",\nflagging\\_options=[\""wrong sign\"", \""off by one\"", \""other\""]\n)\niface.launch()\n```\nWhen users click the flag button, the csv file will now include a column indicating the selected option. \\_flagged/logs.csv\\_\n```csv\nnum1,operation,num2,Output,flag,timestamp\n5,add,7,-12,wrong sign,2022-02-04 11:40:51.093412\n6,subtract,1.5,3.5,off by one,2022-02-04 11:42:32.062512\n```\n## The HuggingFaceDatasetSaver Callback\nSometimes, saving the data to a local CSV file doesn't make sense.""]","The default setting for the `allow_flagging` parameter in Gradio's `Interface` is `""manual""`.

The model replaces the self-attention layer in a BERT\nmodel with a fourier transform which returns only the real parts of the transform. The model is significantly faster\nthan the BERT model because it has fewer parameters and is more memory efficient. The model achieves about 92-97%\naccuracy of BERT counterparts on GLUE benchmark, and trains much faster than the BERT model. The abstract from the\npaper is the following:\n\\*We show that Transformer encoder architectures can be sped up, with limited accuracy costs, by replacing the\nself-attention sublayers with simple linear transformations that \""mix\"" input tokens. These linear mixers, along with\nstandard nonlinearities in feed-forward layers, prove competent at modeling semantic relationships in several text\nclassification tasks. Most surprisingly, we find that replacing the self-attention sublayer in a Transformer encoder\nwith a standard, unparameterized Fourier Transform achieves 92-97% of the accuracy of BERT counterparts on the GLUE\nbenchmark, but trains 80% faster on GPUs and 70% faster on TPUs at standard 512 input lengths. At longer input lengths,\nour FNet model is significantly faster: when compared to the \""efficient\"" Transformers on the Long Range Arena\nbenchmark, FNet matches the accuracy of the most accurate models, while outpacing the fastest models across all\nsequence lengths on GPUs (and across relatively shorter lengths on TPUs). Finally, FNet has a light memory footprint\nand is particularly efficient at smaller model sizes; for a fixed speed and accuracy budget, small FNet models\noutperform Transformer counterparts.\\*\nThis model was contributed by [gchhablani](https://huggingface.co/gchhablani). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/f\\_net). ## Usage tips\nThe model was trained without an attention mask as it is based on Fourier Transform. The model was trained with\nmaximum sequence length 512 which includes pad tokens. Hence, it is highly recommended to use the same maximum\nsequence length for fine-tuning and inference. ## Resources\n- [Text classification task guide](../tasks/sequence\\_classification)\n- [Token classification task guide](../tasks/token\\_classification)\n- [Question answering task guide](../tasks/question\\_answering)\n- [Masked language modeling task guide](../tasks/masked\\_language\\_modeling)\n- [Multiple choice task guide](../tasks/multiple\\_choice)\n## FNetConfig\n[[autodoc]] FNetConfig\n## FNetTokenizer\n[[autodoc]] FNetTokenizer\n- build\\_inputs\\_with\\_special\\_tokens\n- get\\_special\\_tokens\\_mask\n- create\\_token\\_type\\_ids\\_from\\_sequences\n- save\\_vocabulary\n## FNetTokenizerFast\n[[autodoc]] FNetTokenizerFast\n## FNetModel\n[[autodoc]] FNetModel\n- forward\n## FNetForPreTraining\n[[autodoc]] FNetForPreTraining\n- forward\n## FNetForMaskedLM\n[[autodoc]] FNetForMaskedLM\n- forward\n## FNetForNextSentencePrediction\n[[autodoc]] FNetForNextSentencePrediction\n- forward\n## FNetForSequenceClassification\n[[autodoc]] FNetForSequenceClassification\n- forward\n## FNetForMultipleChoice\n[[autodoc]] FNetForMultipleChoice\n- forward\n## FNetForTokenClassification\n[[autodoc]] FNetForTokenClassification\n- forward\n## FNetForQuestionAnswering\n[[autodoc]] FNetForQuestionAnswering\n- forward"", ""!--Copyright 2020 The HuggingFace Team.

"What type of test should typically accompany a bug fix in Gradio's testing strategy?
","[""Test Strategy\nVery brief, mildly aspirational test strategy document. This isn't where we are but it is where we want to get to. This document does not detail how to setup an environment or how to run the tests locally nor does it contain any best practices that we try to follow when writing tests, that information exists in the [contributing guide](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). ## Objectives\nThe purposes of all testing activities on Gradio fit one of the following objectives:\n1. Ensure that the Gradio library functions as we expect it to. 2. Enable the maintenance team to quickly identify both the presence and source of defects. 3. Prevent regressions, i.e. if we fix something it should stay fixed. 4. Improve the quality of the codebase in order to ease maintenance efforts. 5. Reduce the amount of manual testing required. ## Scope\nTesting is always a tradeoff. We can't cover everything unless we want to spend all of our time writing and running tests. We should focus on a few keys areas. We should not focus on code coverage but on test coverage following the below criteria:\n- The documented Gradio API (that's the bit that users interact with via python) should be tested thoroughly. (1)\n- Additional gradio elements that are both publicly available and used internally (such as the Python and JS client libraries) should be tested thoroughly. (1)\n- Additional gradio elements that are publicly available should be tested as thoroughly as is reasonable (this could be things like demos/the gradio CLI/ other tooling). The importance of each individual component, and the appropriate investment of effort, needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. (1)\n- Element boundaries should be tested where there is reasonable cause to do so (e.g. config generation) (1)\n- Implementation details should only be tested where there is sufficient complexity to warrant it. (1)\n- Bug fixes should be accompanied by tests wherever is reasonably possible. (3)\n## Types of testing\nOur tests will broadly fall into one of three categories:\n- Static Quality checks\n- Dynamic 'Code' tests\n- Dynamic Functional tests\n### Static Quality checks\nStatic quality checks are generally very fast to run and do not require building the code base."", ""Tests in this category could be browser-based end-to-end tests, accessibility tests, or performance tests. They are sometimes called acceptance tests. ## Testing tools\nWe currently use the following tools:\n### Static quality checks\n- Python type-checking (python)\n- Black linting (python)\n- ruff formatting (python)\n- prettier formatting (javascript/svelte)\n- TypeScript type-checking (javascript/svelte)\n- eslint linting (javascript/svelte) [in progress]\n### Dynamic code tests\n- pytest (python unit and integration tests)\n- vitest (node-based unit and integration tests)\n- playwright (browser-based unit and integration tests)\n### Functional/acceptance tests\n- playwright (full end to end testing)\n- chromatic (visual testing) [in progress]\n- Accessibility testing [to do]\n## Supported environments and versions\nAll operating systems refer to the current runner variants supported by GitHub actions. All unspecified version segments (`x`) refer to latest. | Software | Version(s) | Operating System(s) |\n| -------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------- |\n| Python | `3.8.x` | `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest` |\n| Node | `18.x.x` | `ubuntu-latest` |\n| Browser | `playwright-chrome-x` | `ubuntu-latest` |\n## Test execution\nTests need to be executed in a number of environments and at different stages of the development cycle in order to be useful. The requirements for tests are as follows:\n- \\*\\*Locally\\*\\*: it is important that developers can easily run most tests locally to ensure a passing suite before making a PR. There are some exceptions to this, certain tests may require access to secret values which we cannot make available to all possible contributors for practical security reasons. It is reasonable that it isn't possible to run these tests but they should be disabled by default when running locally. - \\*\\*CI\\*\\* - It is \\_critical\\_ that all tests run successfully in CI with no exceptions. Not every test is required to pass to satisfy CI checks for practical reasons but it is required that all tests should run in CI and notify us if something unexpected happens in order for the development team to take appropriate action. For instructions on how to write and run tests see the [contributing guide](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). ## Managing defects\nAs we formalise our testing strategy and bring / keep our test up to standard, it is important that we have some principles on managing defects as they occur/ are reported. For now we can have one very simple rule:\n- Every bug fix should be accompanied by a test that failed before the fix and passes afterwards. This test should \\_typically\\_ be a dynamic code test but it could be a linting rule or new type if that is appropriate. There are always exceptions but we should think very carefully before ignoring this rule."", ""Thanks [@abidlabs](https://github.com/abidlabs)! - [#6079](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/6079) [`3b2d9eaa3`](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/3b2d9eaa3e84de3e4a0799e4585a94510d665f26) - fix cc build.

"How can you force mixed precision training when initializing the Accelerator in 🤗 Accelerate?
","[""While gradient checkpointing may improve memory efficiency, it slows training by approximately 20%. ## Mixed precision training\n\\*\\*Mixed precision training\\*\\* is a technique that aims to optimize the computational efficiency of training models by\nutilizing lower-precision numerical formats for certain variables. Traditionally, most models use 32-bit floating point\nprecision (fp32 or float32) to represent and process variables. However, not all variables require this high precision\nlevel to achieve accurate results. By reducing the precision of certain variables to lower numerical formats like 16-bit\nfloating point (fp16 or float16), we can speed up the computations. Because in this approach some computations are performed\nin half-precision, while some are still in full precision, the approach is called mixed precision training. Most commonly mixed precision training is achieved by using fp16 (float16) data types, however, some GPU architectures\n(such as the Ampere architecture) offer bf16 and tf32 (CUDA internal data type) data types. Check\nout the [NVIDIA Blog](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/accelerating-ai-training-with-tf32-tensor-cores/) to learn more about\nthe differences between these data types. ### fp16\nThe main advantage of mixed precision training comes from saving the activations in half precision (fp16). Although the gradients are also computed in half precision they are converted back to full precision for the optimization\nstep so no memory is saved here. While mixed precision training results in faster computations, it can also lead to more GPU memory being utilized, especially for small batch sizes. This is because the model is now present on the GPU in both 16-bit and 32-bit precision (1.5x the original model on the GPU). To enable mixed precision training, set the `fp16` flag to `True`:\n```py\ntraining\\_args = TrainingArguments(per\\_device\\_train\\_batch\\_size=4, fp16=True, \\*\\*default\\_args)\n```\nIf you prefer to use 🤗 Accelerate, find the 🤗 Accelerate example [further in this guide](#using-accelerate)."", ""### BF16\nIf you have access to an Ampere or newer hardware you can use bf16 for mixed precision training and evaluation. While\nbf16 has a worse precision than fp16, it has a much bigger dynamic range. In fp16 the biggest number you can have\nis `65535` and any number above that will result in an overflow. A bf16 number can be as large as `3.39e+38` (!) which\nis about the same as fp32 - because both have 8-bits used for the numerical range. You can enable BF16 in the 🤗 Trainer with:\n```python\ntraining\\_args = TrainingArguments(bf16=True, \\*\\*default\\_args)\n```\n### TF32\nThe Ampere hardware uses a magical data type called tf32. It has the same numerical range as fp32 (8-bits), but instead\nof 23 bits precision it has only 10 bits (same as fp16) and uses only 19 bits in total. It's \""magical\"" in the sense that\nyou can use the normal fp32 training and/or inference code and by enabling tf32 support you can get up to 3x throughput\nimprovement. All you need to do is to add the following to your code:\n```\nimport torch\ntorch.backends.cuda.matmul.allow\\_tf32 = True\ntorch.backends.cudnn.allow\\_tf32 = True\n```\nCUDA will automatically switch to using tf32 instead of fp32 where possible, assuming that the used GPU is from the Ampere series. According to [NVIDIA research](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/accelerating-ai-training-with-tf32-tensor-cores/), the\nmajority of machine learning training workloads show the same perplexity and convergence with tf32 training as with fp32. If you're already using fp16 or bf16 mixed precision it may help with the throughput as well. You can enable this mode in the 🤗 Trainer:\n```python\nTrainingArguments(tf32=True, \\*\\*default\\_args)\n```\ntf32 can't be accessed directly via `tensor.to(dtype=torch.tf32)` because it is an internal CUDA data type. You need `torch>=1.7` to use tf32 data types. For additional information on tf32 vs other precisions, please refer to the following benchmarks:\n[RTX-3090](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/14608#issuecomment-1004390803) and\n[A100](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/15026#issuecomment-1004543189). ## Flash Attention 2\nYou can speedup the training throughput by using Flash Attention 2 integration in transformers. Check out the appropriate section in the [single GPU section](./perf\\_infer\\_gpu\\_one#Flash-Attention-2) to learn more about how to load a model with Flash Attention 2 modules. ## Optimizer choice\nThe most common optimizer used to train transformer models is Adam or AdamW (Adam with weight decay)."", ""## Setup\nGet started by installing 🤗 Accelerate:\n```bash\npip install accelerate\n```\nThen import and create an [`~accelerate.Accelerator`] object. The [`~accelerate.Accelerator`] will automatically detect your type of distributed setup and initialize all the necessary components for training. You don't need to explicitly place your model on a device. ```py\n>>> from accelerate import Accelerator\n>>> accelerator = Accelerator()\n```\n## Prepare to accelerate\nThe next step is to pass all the relevant training objects to the [`~accelerate.Accelerator.prepare`] method. This includes your training and evaluation DataLoaders, a model and an optimizer:\n```py\n>>> train\\_dataloader, eval\\_dataloader, model, optimizer = accelerator.prepare(\n... train\\_dataloader, eval\\_dataloader, model, optimizer\n... )\n```\n## Backward\nThe last addition is to replace the typical `loss.backward()` in your training loop with 🤗 Accelerate's [`~accelerate.Accelerator.backward`]method:\n```py\n>>> for epoch in range(num\\_epochs):\n...""]","To force mixed precision training when initializing the `Accelerator` in 🤗 Accelerate, you can set the `mixed_precision` argument to `""fp16""` or `""bf16""` when creating the `Accelerator` object. Here’s how you can do it:

```python
from accelerate import Accelerator

# For fp16 mixed precision
accelerator = Accelerator(mixed_precision=""fp16"")

# For bf16 mixed precision (if you have compatible hardware)
# accelerator = Accelerator(mixed_precision=""bf16"")
```

This will enable mixed precision training using the specified precision format.",By passing `fp16=True` to the Accelerator init.

The various steps of the pipeline are:\n1. The `Normalizer`: in charge of normalizing the text. Common examples of normalization are\nthe [unicode normalization standards](https://unicode.org/reports/tr15/#Norm\\_Forms), such as `NFD` or `NFKC`.

They serve one purpose: to translate text into data that can be processed by the model. Models can only process numbers, so tokenizers need to convert our text inputs to numerical data. In this section, we'll explore exactly what happens in the tokenization pipeline. In NLP tasks, the data that is generally processed is raw text. Here's an example of such text:\n```\nJim Henson was a puppeteer\n```\nHowever, models can only process numbers, so we need to find a way to convert the raw text to numbers. That's what the tokenizers do, and there are a lot of ways to go about this. The goal is to find the most meaningful representation — that is, the one that makes the most sense to the model — and, if possible, the smallest representation. Let's take a look at some examples of tokenization algorithms, and try to answer some of the questions you may have about tokenization. ## Word-based[[word-based]]\nThe first type of tokenizer that comes to mind is \\_word-based\\_. It's generally very easy to set up and use with only a few rules, and it often yields decent results. For example, in the image below, the goal is to split the raw text into words and find a numerical representation for each of them:\n\n![An example of word-based tokenization.](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-course/documentation-images/resolve/main/en/chapter2/word_based_tokenization.svg)\n![An example of word-based tokenization.](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-course/documentation-images/resolve/main/en/chapter2/word_based_tokenization-dark.svg)\n\nThere are different ways to split the text.

In this video, we will look at what actually happens when we use the pipeline function of the Transformers library. More specifically, we will look at the sentiment analysis pipeline, and how it went from the two following sentences to the positive labels with their respective scores. As we have seen in the pipeline presentation, there are three stages in the pipeline. First, we convert the raw texts to numbers the model can make sense of, using a tokenizer. Then, those numbers go through the model, which outputs logits. Finally, the post-processing steps transforms those logits into labels and scores. Let's look in detail at those three steps, and how to replicate them using the Transformers library, beginning with the first stage, tokenization. The tokenization process has several steps. First, the text is split into small chunks called tokens. They can be words, parts of words or punctuation symbols. Then the tokenizer will had some special tokens (if the model expect them). Here the model uses expects a CLS token at the beginning and a SEP token at the end of the sentence to classify. Lastly, the tokenizer matches each token to its unique ID in the vocabulary of the pretrained model. To load such a tokenizer, the Transformers library provides the AutoTokenizer API. The most important method of this class is from\\_pretrained, which will download and cache the configuration and the vocabulary associated to a given checkpoint. Here, the checkpoint used by default for the sentiment analysis pipeline is distilbert base uncased finetuned sst2 english. We instantiate a tokenizer associated with that checkpoint, then feed it the two sentences. Since those two sentences are not of the same size, we will need to pad the shortest one to be able to build an array. This is done by the tokenizer with the option padding=True. With truncation=True, we ensure that any sentence longer than the maximum the model can handle is truncated. Lastly, the return\\_tensors option tells the tokenizer to return a PyTorch tensor.""]","The purpose of tokenizers in the NLP pipeline is to translate raw text into numerical data that can be processed by models.

Given its real case applications in the world and potential negative impacts on society, we think it is important to provide the project with ethical guidelines to guide the development, users’ contributions, and usage of the Diffusers library. The risks associated with using this technology are still being examined, but to name a few: copyrights issues for artists; deep-fake exploitation; sexual content generation in inappropriate contexts; non-consensual impersonation; harmful social biases perpetuating the oppression of marginalized groups."", ""This forces the user to handle the interaction between the different model components, and the serialization format separates the model components into different files. However, this allows for easier debugging and customization. DreamBooth or Textual Inversion training\nis very simple thanks to Diffusers' ability to separate single components of the diffusion pipeline. ## Tweakable, contributor-friendly over abstraction\nFor large parts of the library, Diffusers adopts an important design principle of the [Transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers), which is to prefer copy-pasted code over hasty abstractions. This design principle is very opinionated and stands in stark contrast to popular design principles such as [Don't repeat yourself (DRY)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t\\_repeat\\_yourself). In short, just like Transformers does for modeling files, Diffusers prefers to keep an extremely low level of abstraction and very self-contained code for pipelines and schedulers. Functions, long code blocks, and even classes can be copied across multiple files which at first can look like a bad, sloppy design choice that makes the library unmaintainable. \\*\\*However\\*\\*, this design has proven to be extremely successful for Transformers and makes a lot of sense for community-driven, open-source machine learning libraries because:\n- Machine Learning is an extremely fast-moving field in which paradigms, model architectures, and algorithms are changing rapidly, which therefore makes it very difficult to define long-lasting code abstractions. - Machine Learning practitioners like to be able to quickly tweak existing code for ideation and research and therefore prefer self-contained code over one that contains many abstractions. - Open-source libraries rely on community contributions and therefore must build a library that is easy to contribute to. The more abstract the code, the more dependencies, the harder to read, and the harder to contribute to. Contributors simply stop contributing to very abstract libraries out of fear of breaking vital functionality. If contributing to a library cannot break other fundamental code, not only is it more inviting for potential new contributors, but it is also easier to review and contribute to multiple parts in parallel. At Hugging Face, we call this design the \\*\\*single-file policy\\*\\* which means that almost all of the code of a certain class should be written in a single, self-contained file.""]","The Safety Checker in the Diffusers library is designed to help mitigate potential ethical and social risks associated with the use of diffusion models. Its primary purpose is to filter out harmful or inappropriate content generated by the models, such as explicit or violent imagery. By implementing this safety feature, the Diffusers library aims to promote responsible usage and ensure that the technology is used in a manner that aligns with ethical guidelines and community standards.

This technique works by learning and updating the text embeddings (the new embeddings are tied to a special word you must use in the prompt) to match the example images you provide. If you're training on a GPU with limited vRAM, you should try enabling the `gradient\\_checkpointing` and `mixed\\_precision` parameters in the training command. You can also reduce your memory footprint by using memory-efficient attention with [xFormers](../optimization/xformers). JAX/Flax training is also supported for efficient training on TPUs and GPUs, but it doesn't support gradient checkpointing or xFormers. With the same configuration and setup as PyTorch, the Flax training script should be at least ~70% faster!

"How do you run a Gradio Blocks app in reload mode using a Python IDE?
","[""Developing Faster with Auto-Reloading\n\\*\\*Prerequisite\\*\\*: This Guide requires you to know about Blocks. Make sure to [read the Guide to Blocks first](https://gradio.app/guides/quickstart/#blocks-more-flexibility-and-control). This guide covers auto reloading, reloading in a Python IDE, and using gradio with Jupyter Notebooks. ## Why Auto-Reloading? When you are building a Gradio demo, particularly out of Blocks, you may find it cumbersome to keep re-running your code to test your changes. To make it faster and more convenient to write your code, we've made it easier to \""reload\"" your Gradio apps instantly when you are developing in a \\*\\*Python IDE\\*\\* (like VS Code, Sublime Text, PyCharm, or so on) or generally running your Python code from the terminal. We've also developed an analogous \""magic command\"" that allows you to re-run cells faster if you use \\*\\*Jupyter Notebooks\\*\\* (or any similar environment like Colab). This short Guide will cover both of these methods, so no matter how you write Python, you'll leave knowing how to build Gradio apps faster. ## Python IDE Reload 🔥\nIf you are building Gradio Blocks using a Python IDE, your file of code (let's name it `run.py`) might look something like this:\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\ngr.Markdown(\""# Greetings from Gradio!\"")\ninp = gr.Textbox(placeholder=\""What is your name?\"")\nout = gr.Textbox()\ninp.change(fn=lambda x: f\""Welcome, {x}!\"",\ninputs=inp,\noutputs=out)\nif \\_\\_name\\_\\_ == \""\\_\\_main\\_\\_\"":\ndemo.launch()\n```\nThe problem is that anytime that you want to make a change to your layout, events, or components, you have to close and rerun your app by writing `python run.py`."", ""By default, the Gradio use UTF-8 encoding for scripts. \\*\\*For reload mode\\*\\*, If you are using encoding formats other than UTF-8 (such as cp1252), make sure you've done like this:\n1. Configure encoding declaration of python script, for example: `# -\\*- coding: cp1252 -\\*-`\n2. Confirm that your code editor has identified that encoding format. 3. Run like this: `gradio run.py --encoding cp1252`\n🔥 If your application accepts command line arguments, you can pass them in as well. Here's an example:\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nimport argparse\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\nparser.add\\_argument(\""--name\"", type=str, default=\""User\"")\nargs, unknown = parser.parse\\_known\\_args()\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\ngr.Markdown(f\""# Greetings {args.name}!\"")\ninp = gr.Textbox()\nout = gr.Textbox()\ninp.change(fn=lambda x: x, inputs=inp, outputs=out)\nif \\_\\_name\\_\\_ == \""\\_\\_main\\_\\_\"":\ndemo.launch()\n```\nWhich you could run like this: `gradio run.py --name Gretel`\nAs a small aside, this auto-reloading happens if you change your `run.py` source code or the Gradio source code."", ""WARNING: The --reload flag should not be used in production on Windows. ```\n这里最重要的一行是 `正在观察 ...`。这里发生的情况是 Gradio 将观察 `run.py` 文件所在的目录，如果文件发生更改，它将自动为您重新运行文件。因此，您只需专注于编写代码，Gradio 演示将自动刷新 🥳\n⚠️ 警告：`gradio` 命令不会检测传递给 `launch()` 方法的参数，因为在重新加载模式下从未调用 `launch()` 方法。例如，设置 `launch()` 中的 `auth` 或 `show\\_error` 不会在应用程序中反映出来。\n当您使用重新加载模式时，请记住一件重要的事情：Gradio 专门查找名为 `demo` 的 Gradio Blocks/Interface 演示。如果您将演示命名为其他名称，您需要在代码中的第二个参数中传入演示的 FastAPI 应用程序的名称。对于 Gradio 演示，可以使用 `.app` 属性访问 FastAPI 应用程序。因此，如果您的 `run.py` 文件如下所示：\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nwith gr.Blocks() as my\\_demo:\ngr.Markdown(\""# 来自Gradio的问候！\"")\ninp = gr.Textbox(placeholder=\""您叫什么名字？\"")\nout = gr.Textbox()\ninp.change(fn=lambda x: f\""欢迎，{x}！\"",\ninputs=inp,\noutputs=out)\nif \\_\\_name\\_\\_ == \""\\_\\_main\\_\\_\"":\nmy\\_demo.launch()\n```\n那么您可以这样启动它：`gradio run.py my\\_demo.app`。\nGradio默认使用UTF-8编码格式。对于\\*\\*重新加载模式\\*\\*，如果你的脚本使用的是除UTF-8以外的编码（如GBK）：\n1. 在Python脚本的编码声明处指定你想要的编码格式，如：`# -\\*- coding: gbk -\\*-`\n2. 确保你的代码编辑器识别到该格式。\n3. 执行：`gradio run.py --encoding gbk`\n🔥 如果您的应用程序接受命令行参数，您也可以传递它们。下面是一个例子：\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nimport argparse\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\nparser.add\\_argument(\""--name\"", type=str, default=\""User\"")\nargs, unknown = parser.parse\\_known\\_args()\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\ngr.Markdown(f\""# 欢迎 {args.name}！\"")\ninp = gr.Textbox()\nout = gr.Textbox()\ninp.change(fn=lambda x: x, inputs=inp, outputs=out)\nif \\_\\_name\\_\\_ == \""\\_\\_main\\_\\_\"":\ndemo.launch()\n```\n您可以像这样运行它：`gradio run.py --name Gretel`\n作为一个小提示，只要更改了 `run.py` 源代码或 Gradio 源代码，自动重新加载就会发生。这意味着如果您决定[为 Gradio 做贡献](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)，这将非常有用 ✅\n## Jupyter Notebook 魔法命令🔮\n如果您使用 Jupyter Notebooks（或 Colab Notebooks 等）进行开发，我们也为您提供了一个解决方案！\n我们开发了一个 \\*\\*magic command 魔法命令\\*\\*，可以为您创建和运行一个 Blocks 演示。要使用此功能，在笔记本顶部加载 gradio 扩展：\n`%load\\_ext gradio`\n然后，在您正在开发 Gradio 演示的单元格中，只需在顶部写入魔法命令\\*\\*`%%blocks`\\*\\*，然后像平常一样编写布局和组件：\n```py\n%%blocks\nimport gradio as gr\ngr.Markdown(\""# 来自Gradio的问候！\"")\ninp = gr.Textbox(placeholder=\""您叫什么名字？\"")\nout = gr.Textbox()\ninp.change(fn=lambda x: f\""欢迎，{x}！\"",\ninputs=inp,\noutputs=out)\n```\n请注意：\n- 您不需要放置样板代码 `with gr.Blocks() as demo:` 和 `demo.launch()` — Gradio 会自动为您完成！\n- 每次重新运行单元格时，Gradio 都将在相同的端口上重新启动您的应用程序，并使用相同的底层网络服务器。这意味着您将比正常重新运行单元格更快地看到变化。\n下面是在 Jupyter Notebook 中的示例：\n![](https://i.ibb.co/nrszFws/Blocks.gif)\n🪄这在 colab 笔记本中也适用！[这是一个 colab 笔记本](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jUlX1w7JqckRHVE-nbDyMPyZ7fYD8488?authuser=1#scrollTo=zxHYjbCTTz\\_5)，您可以在其中看到 Blocks 魔法效果。尝试进行一些更改并重新运行带有 Gradio 代码的单元格！\nNotebook Magic 现在是作者构建 Gradio 演示的首选方式。无论您如何编写 Python 代码，我们都希望这两种方法都能为您提供更好的 Gradio 开发体验。\n---\n## 下一步\n既然您已经了解了如何使用 Gradio 快速开发，请开始构建自己的应用程序吧！\n如果你正在寻找灵感，请尝试浏览其他人用 Gradio 构建的演示，[浏览 Hugging Face Spaces](http://hf.space/) 🤗""]","To run a Gradio Blocks app in reload mode using a Python IDE, follow these steps:

1. Create your Gradio app in a Python file (e.g., `run.py`). Here’s a simple example:

   ```python
   import gradio as gr
   with gr.Blocks() as demo:
       gr.Markdown(""# Greetings from Gradio!"")
       inp = gr.Textbox(placeholder=""What is your name?"")
       out = gr.Textbox()
       inp.change(fn=lambda x: f""Welcome, {x}!"", inputs=inp, outputs=out)
   if __name__ == ""__main__"":
       demo.launch()
   ```

2. By default, Gradio uses UTF-8 encoding for scripts. If you are using a different encoding (like cp1252), make sure to:
   - Configure the encoding declaration in your Python script, for example: `# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-`
   - Confirm that your code editor recognizes that encoding format.
   - Run your script with the command: `gradio run.py --encoding cp1252`

3. To enable auto-reloading, simply run your script using the command: `gradio run.py`. Gradio will watch for changes in your `run.py` file and automatically reload the app when changes are detected.

4. If your application accepts command line arguments, you can pass them as well. For example:

   ```python
   import gradio as gr
   import argparse
   parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
   parser.add_argument(""--name"", type=str, default=""User"")
   args, unknown = parser.parse_known_args()
   with gr.Blocks() as demo:
       gr.Markdown(f""# Greetings {args.name}!"")
       inp = gr.Textbox()
       out = gr.Textbox()
       inp.change(fn=lambda x: x, inputs=inp, outputs=out)
   if __name__ == ""__main__"":
       demo.launch()
   ```

   You can run it like this: `gradio run.py --name Gretel`.

Remember, the `--reload` flag should not be used in production on Windows, and Gradio specifically looks for a Gradio Blocks/Interface demo named `demo`. If your demo is named differently, you need to pass the FastAPI app name in the command.",Run `gradio run.py` in the terminal.
"How can you install the Hugging Face Unity API in your Unity project?
","[""--\ntitle: \""How to Install and Use the Hugging Face Unity API\""\nthumbnail: /blog/assets/124\\_ml-for-games/unity-api-thumbnail.png\nauthors:\n- user: dylanebert\n---\n# How to Install and Use the Hugging Face Unity API\nThe [Hugging Face Unity API](https://github.com/huggingface/unity-api) is an easy-to-use integration of the [Hugging Face Inference API](https://huggingface.co/inference-api), allowing developers to access and use Hugging Face AI models in their Unity projects. In this blog post, we'll walk through the steps to install and use the Hugging Face Unity API. ## Installation\n1. Open your Unity project\n2. Go to `Window` -> `Package Manager`\n3. Click `+` and select `Add Package from git URL`\n4. Enter `https://github.com/huggingface/unity-api.git`\n5. Once installed, the Unity API wizard should pop up. If not, go to `Window` -> `Hugging Face API Wizard`\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/124_ml-for-games/packagemanager.gif)\n6. Enter your API key. Your API key can be created in your [Hugging Face account settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens). 7. Test the API key by clicking `Test API key` in the API Wizard. 8. Optionally, change the model endpoints to change which model to use. The model endpoint for any model that supports the inference API can be found by going to the model on the Hugging Face website, clicking `Deploy` -> `Inference API`, and copying the url from the `API\\_URL` field."", ""9. Configure advanced settings if desired. For up-to-date information, visit the project repository at `https://github.com/huggingface/unity-api`\n10. To see examples of how to use the API, click `Install Examples`. You can now close the API Wizard. ![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/124_ml-for-games/apiwizard.png)\nNow that the API is set up, you can make calls from your scripts to the API. Let's look at an example of performing a Sentence Similarity task:\n```\nusing HuggingFace.API;\n/\\* other code \\*/\n// Make a call to the API\nvoid Query() {\nstring inputText = \""I'm on my way to the forest.\"";\nstring[] candidates = {\n\""The player is going to the city\"",\n\""The player is going to the wilderness\"",\n\""The player is wandering aimlessly\""\n};\nHuggingFaceAPI.SentenceSimilarity(inputText, OnSuccess, OnError, candidates);\n}\n// If successful, handle the result\nvoid OnSuccess(float[] result) {\nforeach(float value in result) {\nDebug.Log(value);\n}\n}\n// Otherwise, handle the error\nvoid OnError(string error) {\nDebug.LogError(error);\n}\n/\\* other code \\*/\n```\n## Supported Tasks and Custom Models\nThe Hugging Face Unity API also currently supports the following tasks:\n- [Conversation](https://huggingface.co/tasks/conversational)\n- [Text Generation](https://huggingface.co/tasks/text-generation)\n- [Text to Image](https://huggingface.co/tasks/text-to-image)\n- [Text Classification](https://huggingface.co/tasks/text-classification)\n- [Question Answering](https://huggingface.co/tasks/question-answering)\n- [Translation](https://huggingface.co/tasks/translation)\n- [Summarization](https://huggingface.co/tasks/summarization)\n- [Speech Recognition](https://huggingface.co/tasks/automatic-speech-recognition)\nUse the corresponding methods provided by the `HuggingFaceAPI` class to perform these tasks."", ""### 4. Speech Recognition\nNext, we'll want to use the Hugging Face Unity API to run speech recognition on our encoded audio. To do so, we'll create a `SendRecording()` method:\n```\nusing HuggingFace.API;\nprivate void SendRecording() {\nHuggingFaceAPI.AutomaticSpeechRecognition(bytes, response => {\ntext.color = Color.white;\ntext.text = response;\n}, error => {\ntext.color = Color.red;\ntext.text = error;\n});\n}\n```\nThis will send the encoded audio to the API, displaying the response in white if successful, otherwise the error message in red. Don't forget to call `SendRecording()` at the end of the `StopRecording()` method:\n```\nprivate void StopRecording() {\n/\\* other code \\*/\nSendRecording();\n}\n```\n### 5. Final Touches\nFinally, let's improve the UX of this demo a bit using button interactability and status messages. The Start and Stop buttons should only be interactable when appropriate, i.e. when a recording is ready to be started/stopped. Then, set the response text to a simple status message while recording or waiting for the API. The finished script should look something like this:\n```\nusing System.IO;\nusing HuggingFace.API;\nusing TMPro;\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing UnityEngine.UI;\npublic class SpeechRecognitionTest : MonoBehaviour {\n[SerializeField] private Button startButton;\n[SerializeField] private Button stopButton;\n[SerializeField] private TextMeshProUGUI text;\nprivate AudioClip clip;\nprivate byte[] bytes;\nprivate bool recording;\nprivate void Start() {\nstartButton.onClick.AddListener(StartRecording);\nstopButton.onClick.AddListener(StopRecording);\nstopButton.interactable = false;\n}\nprivate void Update() {\nif (recording && Microphone.GetPosition(null) >= clip.samples) {\nStopRecording();\n}\n}\nprivate void StartRecording() {\ntext.color = Color.white;\ntext.text = \""Recording...\"";\nstartButton.interactable = false;\nstopButton.interactable = true;\nclip = Microphone.Start(null, false, 10, 44100);\nrecording = true;\n}\nprivate void StopRecording() {\nvar position = Microphone.GetPosition(null);\nMicrophone.End(null);\nvar samples = new float[position \\* clip.channels];\nclip.GetData(samples, 0);\nbytes = EncodeAsWAV(samples, clip.frequency, clip.channels);\nrecording = false;\nSendRecording();\n}\nprivate void SendRecording() {\ntext.color = Color.yellow;\ntext.text = \""Sending...\"";\nstopButton.interactable = false;\nHuggingFaceAPI.AutomaticSpeechRecognition(bytes, response => {\ntext.color = Color.white;\ntext.text = response;\nstartButton.interactable = true;\n}, error => {\ntext.color = Color.red;\ntext.text = error;\nstartButton.interactable = true;\n});\n}\nprivate byte[] EncodeAsWAV(float[] samples, int frequency, int channels) {\nusing (var memoryStream = new MemoryStream(44 + samples.Length \\* 2)) {\nusing (var writer = new BinaryWriter(memoryStream)) {\nwriter.Write(\""RIFF\"".ToCharArray());\nwriter.Write(36 + samples.Length \\* 2);\nwriter.Write(\""WAVE\"".ToCharArray());\nwriter.Write(\""fmt \"".ToCharArray());\nwriter.Write(16);\nwriter.Write((ushort)1);\nwriter.Write((ushort)channels);\nwriter.Write(frequency);\nwriter.Write(frequency \\* channels \\* 2);\nwriter.Write((ushort)(channels \\* 2));\nwriter.Write((ushort)16);\nwriter.Write(\""data\"".ToCharArray());\nwriter.Write(samples.Length \\* 2);\nforeach (var sample in samples) {\nwriter.Write((short)(sample \\* short.MaxValue));\n}\n}\nreturn memoryStream.ToArray();\n}\n}\n}\n```\nCongratulations, you can now use state-of-the-art Speech Recognition in Unity!

","[""Wav2Vec2 Contrastive Loss PreTraining examples\nThe following example showcases how to pretrain a wav2vec2 model using the JAX/Flax backend. Pretraining Wav2Vec2 is rather complex, so it is highly recommended to read the\n[official paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11477). JAX/Flax allows you to trace pure functions and compile them into efficient, fused accelerator code on both GPU and TPU. Models written in JAX/Flax are \\*\\*immutable\\*\\* and updated in a purely functional\nway which enables simple and efficient model parallelism. `run\\_wav2vec2\\_pretrain\\_flax.py` is a lightweight example of how to download and preprocess a dataset from the 🤗 Datasets library or use your own files (jsonlines or csv), then pretrain the wav2vec2 architectures above on it. For custom datasets in `jsonlines` format please see: [the Datasets documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/loading\\_datasets#json-files) and you also will find examples of these below. Let's start by creating a model repository to save the trained model and logs. Here we call the model `\""wav2vec2-base-robust\""`, but you can change the model name as you like. You can do this either directly on [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/new) (assuming that\nyou are logged in) or via the command line:\n```\nhuggingface-cli repo create wav2vec2-base-robust\n```\nNext we clone the model repository to add the tokenizer and model files. ```\ngit clone https://huggingface.co//wav2vec2-base-robust\n```\nTo ensure that all tensorboard traces will be uploaded correctly, we need to\ntrack them. You can run the following command inside your model repo to do so. ```\ncd wav2vec2-base-robust\ngit lfs track \""\\*tfevents\\*\""\n```\nGreat, we have set up our model repository. During training, we will automatically\npush the training logs and model weights to the repo. Next, let's add a symbolic link to the `run\\_wav2vec2\\_pretrain\\_flax`. ```bash\nexport MODEL\\_DIR=\""./wav2vec2-base-robust\""\nln -s ~/transformers/examples/research\\_projects/jax-projects/wav2vec2/run\\_wav2vec2\\_pretrain\\_flax.py ./\n```\n### Create the model configuration\nLet's first create the model configuration and store it in the model repository."", ""!---\nCopyright 2021 The HuggingFace Team.

The abstract from the paper is the following:\n\\*We show for the first time that learning powerful representations from speech audio alone followed by fine-tuning on\ntranscribed speech can outperform the best semi-supervised methods while being conceptually simpler. wav2vec 2.0 masks\nthe speech input in the latent space and solves a contrastive task defined over a quantization of the latent\nrepresentations which are jointly learned. Experiments using all labeled data of Librispeech achieve 1.8/3.3 WER on the\nclean/other test sets. When lowering the amount of labeled data to one hour, wav2vec 2.0 outperforms the previous state\nof the art on the 100 hour subset while using 100 times less labeled data. Using just ten minutes of labeled data and\npre-training on 53k hours of unlabeled data still achieves 4.8/8.2 WER. This demonstrates the feasibility of speech\nrecognition with limited amounts of labeled data.\\*\nThis model was contributed by [patrickvonplaten](https://huggingface.co/patrickvonplaten). ## Usage tips\n- Wav2Vec2 is a speech model that accepts a float array corresponding to the raw waveform of the speech signal. - Wav2Vec2 model was trained using connectionist temporal classification (CTC) so the model output has to be decoded\nusing [`Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer`]. ## Resources\nA list of official Hugging Face and community (indicated by 🌎) resources to help you get started with Wav2Vec2.""]","The pretraining objective of the Wav2Vec2 context network is to solve a contrastive task defined over a quantization of the latent representations. This involves masking parts of the speech input in the latent space and training the model to predict the masked portions based on the unmasked context. This approach allows the model to learn powerful representations from speech audio alone, which can then be fine-tuned on transcribed speech for improved performance in speech recognition tasks.",The pretraining objective of the Wav2Vec2 context network is a contrastive task where the model has to predict the true quantized speech representation of the masked prediction from a set of false ones.
"What is the default checkpoint used by the sentiment analysis pipeline in the Transformers library?
","[""hat happens inside the pipeline function? In this video, we will look at what actually happens when we use the pipeline function of the Transformers library. More specifically, we will look at the sentiment analysis pipeline, and how it went from the two following sentences to the positive labels with their respective scores. As we have seen in the pipeline presentation, there are three stages in the pipeline. First, we convert the raw texts to numbers the model can make sense of, using a tokenizer. Then, those numbers go through the model, which outputs logits. Finally, the post-processing steps transforms those logits into labels and scores. Let's look in detail at those three steps, and how to replicate them using the Transformers library, beginning with the first stage, tokenization. The tokenization process has several steps. First, the text is split into small chunks called tokens. They can be words, parts of words or punctuation symbols. Then the tokenizer will had some special tokens (if the model expect them). Here the model uses expects a CLS token at the beginning and a SEP token at the end of the sentence to classify. Lastly, the tokenizer matches each token to its unique ID in the vocabulary of the pretrained model. To load such a tokenizer, the Transformers library provides the AutoTokenizer API. The most important method of this class is from\\_pretrained, which will download and cache the configuration and the vocabulary associated to a given checkpoint. Here, the checkpoint used by default for the sentiment analysis pipeline is distilbert base uncased finetuned sst2 english. We instantiate a tokenizer associated with that checkpoint, then feed it the two sentences. Since those two sentences are not of the same size, we will need to pad the shortest one to be able to build an array. This is done by the tokenizer with the option padding=True. With truncation=True, we ensure that any sentence longer than the maximum the model can handle is truncated. Lastly, the return\\_tensors option tells the tokenizer to return a TensorFlow tensor."", ""Transformers, what can they do?[[transformers-what-can-they-do]]\nIn this section, we will look at what Transformer models can do and use our first tool from the 🤗 Transformers library: the `pipeline()` function. 👀 See that *Open in Colab* button on the top right?

[Create a huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/join) account to benefit from all available features! Before diving into how Transformer models work under the hood, let's look at a few examples of how they can be used to solve some interesting NLP problems. ## Working with pipelines[[working-with-pipelines]]\nThe most basic object in the 🤗 Transformers library is the `pipeline()` function. It connects a model with its necessary preprocessing and postprocessing steps, allowing us to directly input any text and get an intelligible answer:\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\nclassifier = pipeline(\""sentiment-analysis\"")\nclassifier(\""I've been waiting for a HuggingFace course my whole life.\"")\n```\n```python out\n[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9598047137260437}]\n```\nWe can even pass several sentences! ```python\nclassifier(\n[\""I've been waiting for a HuggingFace course my whole life.\"", \""I hate this so much!\""]\n)\n```\n```python out\n[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9598047137260437},\n{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9994558095932007}]\n```\nBy default, this pipeline selects a particular pretrained model that has been fine-tuned for sentiment analysis in English."", ""he pipeline function. The pipeline function is the most high-level API of the Transformers library. It regroups together all the steps to go from raw texts to usable predictions. The model used is at the core of a pipeline, but the pipeline also include all the necessary pre-processing (since the model does not expect texts, but numbers) as well as some post-processing to make the output of the model human-readable. Let's look at a first example with the sentiment analysis pipeline. This pipeline performs text classification on a given input, and determines if it's positive or negative. Here, it attributed the positive label on the given text, with a confidence of 95%. You can pass multiple texts to the same pipeline, which will be processed and passed through the model together, as a batch. The output is a list of individual results, in the same order as the input texts. Here we find the same label and score for the first text, and the second text is judged positive with a confidence of 99.99%. The zero-shot classification pipeline is a more general text-classification pipeline: it allows you to provide the labels you want.""]",The default checkpoint used by the sentiment analysis pipeline in the Transformers library is `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst2-english`.,distilbert base uncased finetuned sst2 english
"What is the purpose of the notebook ""How to use DeepSpeed to train models with billions of parameters on Habana Gaudi""?
","[""Although these devices have quite a lot of memory, the model is so large that a single device is not enough to contain a single instance of BLOOMZ. To solve this issue, we are going to use [DeepSpeed](https://www.deepspeed.ai/), which is a deep learning optimization library that enables many memory and speed improvements to accelerate the model and make it fit the device. In particular, we rely here on [DeepSpeed-inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00032): it introduces several features such as [model (or pipeline) parallelism](https://huggingface.co/blog/bloom-megatron-deepspeed#pipeline-parallelism) to make the most of the available devices. For Gaudi2, we use [Habana's DeepSpeed fork](https://github.com/HabanaAI/deepspeed) that adds support for HPUs. ### Latency\nWe measured latencies (batch of one sample) for two different sizes of BLOOMZ, both with multi-billion parameters:\n- [176 billion](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz) parameters\n- [7 billion](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz-7b1) parameters\nRuns were performed with DeepSpeed-inference in 16-bit precision with 8 devices and using a [key-value cache](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.27.1/en/model\\_doc/bloom#transformers.BloomForCausalLM.forward.use\\_cache)."", ""Note that while [CUDA graphs](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/cuda-graphs/) are not currently compatible with model parallelism in DeepSpeed (DeepSpeed v0.8.2, see [here](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed/blob/v0.8.2/deepspeed/inference/engine.py#L158)), HPU graphs are supported in Habana's DeepSpeed fork.

The input prompt is:\n> \""DeepSpeed is a machine learning framework\""\nwhich consists of 7 tokens with BLOOM's tokenizer.

Smaller checkpoints present interesting results too. \\*\\*Gaudi2 is 2.89x faster than A100 for BLOOMZ-7B!\\*\\* It is also interesting to note that it manages to benefit from model parallelism whereas A100 is faster on a single device. We also ran these models on first-gen Gaudi. While it is slower than Gaudi2, it is interesting from a price perspective as a DL1 instance on AWS costs approximately 13\\$ per hour.

Thus, \\*\\*first-gen Gaudi offers for the 7-billion checkpoint a better price-performance ratio than A100\\*\\* which costs more than 30\\$ per hour! We expect the Habana team will optimize the performance of these models in the upcoming SynapseAI releases. For example, in our last benchmark, we saw that [Gaudi2 performs Stable Diffusion inference 2.2x faster than A100](https://huggingface.co/blog/habana-gaudi-2-benchmark#generating-images-from-text-with-stable-diffusion) and this has since been improved further to 2.37x with the latest optimizations provided by Habana.

"What command line module does PyTorch provide to run a script on multiple GPUs?
","[""## PyTorch Distributed\nPyTorch supports [`DistributedDataParallel`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel.html) which enables data parallelism. To start, create a Python file and import `torch.distributed` and `torch.multiprocessing` to set up the distributed process group and to spawn the processes for inference on each GPU. You should also initialize a [`DiffusionPipeline`]:\n```py\nimport torch\nimport torch.distributed as dist\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\nfrom diffusers import DiffusionPipeline\nsd = DiffusionPipeline.from\\_pretrained(\n\""runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5\"", torch\\_dtype=torch.float16, use\\_safetensors=True\n)\n```\nYou'll want to create a function to run inference; [`init\\_process\\_group`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html?highlight=init\\_process\\_group#torch.distributed.init\\_process\\_group) handles creating a distributed environment with the type of backend to use, the `rank` of the current process, and the `world\\_size` or the number of processes participating. If you're running inference in parallel over 2 GPUs, then the `world\\_size` is 2. Move the [`DiffusionPipeline`] to `rank` and use `get\\_rank` to assign a GPU to each process, where each process handles a different prompt:\n```py\ndef run\\_inference(rank, world\\_size):\ndist.init\\_process\\_group(\""nccl\"", rank=rank, world\\_size=world\\_size)\nsd.to(rank)\nif torch.distributed.get\\_rank() == 0:\nprompt = \""a dog\""\nelif torch.distributed.get\\_rank() == 1:\nprompt = \""a cat\""\nimage = sd(prompt).images[0]\nimage.save(f\""./{'\\_'.join(prompt)}.png\"")\n```\nTo run the distributed inference, call [`mp.spawn`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/multiprocessing.html#torch.multiprocessing.spawn) to run the `run\\_inference` function on the number of GPUs defined in `world\\_size`:\n```py\ndef main():\nworld\\_size = 2\nmp.spawn(run\\_inference, args=(world\\_size,), nprocs=world\\_size, join=True)\nif \\_\\_name\\_\\_ == \""\\_\\_main\\_\\_\"":\nmain()\n```\nOnce you've completed the inference script, use the `--nproc\\_per\\_node` argument to specify the number of GPUs to use and call `torchrun` to run the script:\n```bash\ntorchrun run\\_distributed.py --nproc\\_per\\_node=2\n```"", ""Again, remember to ensure to adjust `TORCH\\_CUDA\\_ARCH\\_LIST` to the target architectures. You can find the complete list of NVIDIA GPUs and their corresponding \\*\\*Compute Capabilities\\*\\* (same as arch in this\ncontext) [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus).

You can also leave `TORCH\\_CUDA\\_ARCH\\_LIST` out completely and then the build program will automatically query the\narchitecture of the GPUs the build is made on. This may or may not match the GPUs on the target machines, that's why\nit's best to specify the desired archs explicitly. If after trying everything suggested you still encounter build issues, please, proceed with the GitHub Issue of\n[Deepspeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed/issues),\n### Deployment with multiple GPUs\nTo deploy the DeepSpeed integration adjust the [`Trainer`] command line arguments to include a new argument `--deepspeed ds\\_config.json`, where `ds\\_config.json` is the DeepSpeed configuration file as\ndocumented [here](https://www.deepspeed.ai/docs/config-json/)."", ""The file naming is up to you. It's recommended to use DeepSpeed's `add\\_config\\_arguments` utility to add the necessary command line arguments to your code. For more information please see [DeepSpeed's Argument Parsing](https://deepspeed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/initialize.html#argument-parsing) doc. You can use a launcher of your choice here. You can continue using the pytorch launcher:\n```bash\ntorch.distributed.run --nproc\\_per\\_node=2 your\\_program.py  --deepspeed ds\\_config.json\n```\nor use the launcher provided by `deepspeed`:\n```bash\ndeepspeed --num\\_gpus=2 your\\_program.py  --deepspeed ds\\_config.json\n```\nAs you can see the arguments aren't the same, but for most needs either of them works.

When you use the `deepspeed` launcher and you want to use all available gpus you can just omit the `--num\\_gpus` flag. Here is an example of running `run\\_translation.py` under DeepSpeed deploying all available GPUs:\n```bash\ndeepspeed examples/pytorch/translation/run\\_translation.py \\\n--deepspeed tests/deepspeed/ds\\_config\\_zero3.json \\\n--model\\_name\\_or\\_path t5-small --per\\_device\\_train\\_batch\\_size 1 \\\n--output\\_dir output\\_dir --overwrite\\_output\\_dir --fp16 \\\n--do\\_train --max\\_train\\_samples 500 --num\\_train\\_epochs 1 \\\n--dataset\\_name wmt16 --dataset\\_config \""ro-en\"" \\\n--source\\_lang en --target\\_lang ro\n```\nNote that in the DeepSpeed documentation you are likely to see `--deepspeed --deepspeed\\_config ds\\_config.json` - i.e. two DeepSpeed-related arguments, but for the sake of simplicity, and since there are already so many arguments to deal\nwith, we combined the two into a single argument. For some practical usage examples, please, see this [post](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/8771#issuecomment-759248400). ### Deployment with one GPU\nTo deploy DeepSpeed with one GPU adjust the [`Trainer`] command line arguments as follows:\n```bash\ndeepspeed --num\\_gpus=1 examples/pytorch/translation/run\\_translation.py \\\n--deepspeed tests/deepspeed/ds\\_config\\_zero2.json \\\n--model\\_name\\_or\\_path t5-small --per\\_device\\_train\\_batch\\_size 1 \\\n--output\\_dir output\\_dir --overwrite\\_output\\_dir --fp16 \\\n--do\\_train --max\\_train\\_samples 500 --num\\_train\\_epochs 1 \\\n--dataset\\_name wmt16 --dataset\\_config \""ro-en\"" \\\n--source\\_lang en --target\\_lang ro\n```\nThis is almost the same as with multiple-GPUs, but here we tell DeepSpeed explicitly to use just one GPU via\n`--num\\_gpus=1`. By default, DeepSpeed deploys all GPUs it can see on the given node. If you have only 1 GPU to start\nwith, then you don't need this argument. The following [documentation](https://www.deepspeed.ai/getting-started/#resource-configuration-multi-node) discusses the launcher options.""]","PyTorch provides the `torch.distributed.run` command line module to run a script on multiple GPUs. You can use it with the `--nproc_per_node` argument to specify the number of GPUs to use. For example:

```bash
torch.distributed.run --nproc_per_node=2 your_program.py
``` 

This allows you to execute your script in a distributed manner across the specified number of GPUs.",torchrun

The abstract from the paper is the following:\n\\*While the Transformer architecture has become the de-facto standard for natural language processing tasks, its\napplications to computer vision remain limited. In vision, attention is either applied in conjunction with\nconvolutional networks, or used to replace certain components of convolutional networks while keeping their overall\nstructure in place. We show that this reliance on CNNs is not necessary and a pure transformer applied directly to\nsequences of image patches can perform very well on image classification tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of\ndata and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.),\nVision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring\nsubstantially fewer computational resources to train.\\*\n![drawing](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/model_doc/vit_architecture.jpg)\n ViT architecture. Taken from the [original paper.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) \nFollowing the original Vision Transformer, some follow-up works have been made:\n- [DeiT](deit) (Data-efficient Image Transformers) by Facebook AI. DeiT models are distilled vision transformers. The authors of DeiT also released more efficiently trained ViT models, which you can directly plug into [`ViTModel`] or\n[`ViTForImageClassification`]. There are 4 variants available (in 3 different sizes): \\*facebook/deit-tiny-patch16-224\\*,\n\\*facebook/deit-small-patch16-224\\*, \\*facebook/deit-base-patch16-224\\* and \\*facebook/deit-base-patch16-384\\*."", ""With so many Transformer variants available, it can be easy to miss the bigger picture. What all these models have in common is they're based on the original Transformer architecture. Some models only use the encoder or decoder, while others use both. This provides a useful taxonomy to categorize and examine the high-level differences within models in the Transformer family, and it'll help you understand Transformers you haven't encountered before. If you aren't familiar with the original Transformer model or need a refresher, check out the [How do Transformers work](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/4?fw=pt) chapter from the Hugging Face course.## Computer vision\n### Convolutional network\nFor a long time, convolutional networks (CNNs) were the dominant paradigm for computer vision tasks until the [Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) demonstrated its scalability and efficiency. Even then, some of a CNN's best qualities, like translation invariance, are so powerful (especially for certain tasks) that some Transformers incorporate convolutions in their architecture. [ConvNeXt](model\\_doc/convnext) flipped this exchange around and incorporated design choices from Transformers to modernize a CNN. For example, ConvNeXt uses non-overlapping sliding windows to patchify an image and a larger kernel to increase its global receptive field. ConvNeXt also makes several layer design choices to be more memory-efficient and improve performance, so it competes favorably with Transformers! ### Encoder[[cv-encoder]]\nThe [Vision Transformer (ViT)](model\\_doc/vit) opened the door to computer vision tasks without convolutions. ViT uses a standard Transformer encoder, but its main breakthrough was how it treated an image. It splits an image into fixed-size patches and uses them to create an embedding, just like how a sentence is split into tokens. ViT capitalized on the Transformers' efficient architecture to demonstrate competitive results with the CNNs at the time while requiring fewer resources to train. ViT was soon followed by other vision models that could also handle dense vision tasks like segmentation as well as detection. One of these models is the [Swin](model\\_doc/swin) Transformer. It builds hierarchical feature maps (like a CNN 👀 and unlike ViT) from smaller-sized patches and merges them with neighboring patches in deeper layers. Attention is only computed within a local window, and the window is shifted between attention layers to create connections to help the model learn better. Since the Swin Transformer can produce hierarchical feature maps, it is a good candidate for dense prediction tasks like segmentation and detection. The [SegFormer](model\\_doc/segformer) also uses a Transformer encoder to build hierarchical feature maps, but it adds a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) decoder on top to combine all the feature maps and make a prediction. Other vision models, like BeIT and ViTMAE, drew inspiration from BERT's pretraining objective. [BeIT](model\\_doc/beit) is pretrained by \\*masked image modeling (MIM)\\*; the image patches are randomly masked, and the image is also tokenized into visual tokens. BeIT is trained to predict the visual tokens corresponding to the masked patches. [ViTMAE](model\\_doc/vitmae) has a similar pretraining objective, except it must predict the pixels instead of visual tokens.""]","The most popular Vision Transformer model for image classification on the Hugging Face Model Hub is typically the `ViT` (Vision Transformer) model itself, along with its variants like `DeiT` (Data-efficient Image Transformers). These models have been widely used and have shown excellent performance on various image classification tasks.

In order to handle a repository, you should first have a Hugging Face account. A link to create a new account is available in the description. Once you are logged in, you can create a new repository by clicking on the \""New model\"" option. You should be facing a similar modal to the following. In the \""Owner\"" input, you can put either your own namespace or any of your organisations namespaces. The model name is the model identifier that will then be used to identify your model on your chosen namespace. The final choice is between public and private. Public models are accessible by anyone. This is the recommended, free option, as this makes your model easily accessible and shareable. The owners of your namespace are the only ones who can update and change your model. A more advanced option is the private option. In this case, only the owners of your namespace will have visibility over your model. Other users won't know it exists and will not be able to use it.

As such, the first place developers can work to mitigate bias is when deciding how ML fits in their system, e.g., by deciding what optimization objective it will use. For example, let’s go back to one of the first highly-publicized cases of a Machine Learning system used in production for algorithmic content recommendation. From 2006 to 2009, Netflix ran the [Netflix Prize](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/KDD-cup-2007/proceedings/The-Netflix-Prize-Bennett.pdf), a competition with a 1M$ cash prize challenging teams around the world to develop ML systems to accurately predict a user’s rating for a new movie based on their past ratings. The [winning submission](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/statistics/dmsl/GrandPrize2009\\_BPC\\_BigChaos.pdf) improved the RMSE (Root-mean-square-error) of predictions on unseen user-movie pairs by over 10% over Netflix’s own CineMatch algorithm, meaning it got much better at predicting how users would rate a new movie based on their history."", ""Conceptualizing bias as a risk factor then allows us to better understand the \\*\\*shared responsibility\\*\\* for machine biases between developers at all stages. Bias can never be fully removed, not least because the definitions of social biases and the power dynamics that tie them to discrimination vary vastly across social contexts. However:\n1.

However, training them at scale often requires a large amount of computing power, making the whole process unnecessarily long, complex, and costly. Today, [Habana® Labs](https://habana.ai/), a pioneer in high-efficiency, purpose-built deep learning processors, and Hugging Face, the home of [Transformer](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) models, are happy to announce that they’re joining forces to make it easier and quicker to train high-quality transformer models. Thanks to the integration of Habana’s [SynapseAI software suite](https://habana.ai/training-software/) with the Hugging Face [Optimum open-source library](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum), data scientists and machine learning engineers can now accelerate their Transformer training jobs on Habana processors with just a few lines of code and enjoy greater productivity as well as lower training cost. [Habana Gaudi](https://habana.ai/training/) training solutions, which power Amazon’s EC2 DL1 instances and Supermicro’s X12 Gaudi AI Training Server, deliver price/performance up to 40% lower than comparable training solutions and enable customers to train more while spending less. The integration of ten 100 Gigabit Ethernet ports onto every Gaudi processor enables system scaling from 1 to thousands of Gaudis with ease and cost-efficiency. Habana’s SynapseAI® is optimized—at inception—to enable Gaudi performance and usability, supports TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks, with a focus on computer vision and natural language processing applications. With 60,000+ stars on Github, 30,000+ models, and millions of monthly visits, Hugging Face is one of the fastest-growing projects in open source software history, and the go-to place for the machine learning community. With its [Hardware Partner Program](https://huggingface.co/hardware), Hugging Face provides Gaudi’s advanced deep learning hardware with the ultimate Transformer toolset. This partnership will enable rapid expansion of the Habana Gaudi training transformer model library, bringing Gaudi efficiency and ease of use to a wide array of customer use cases like natural language processing, computer vision, speech, and more. “\\*We’re excited to partner with Hugging Face and its many open-source developers to address the growing demand for transformer models that benefit from the efficiency, usability, and scalability of the Gaudi training platform\\*”, said Sree Ganesan, head of software product management, Habana Labs. “Habana Gaudi brings a new level of efficiency to deep learning model training, and we’re super excited to make this performance easily accessible to Transformer users with minimal code changes through Optimum”, said Jeff Boudier, product director at Hugging Face.

Not only do we strive to advance Transformer models, but we also work hard on simplifying their adoption. Today, we're excited to announce that Intel has officially joined our [Hardware Partner Program](https://huggingface.co/hardware). Thanks to the [Optimum](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel) open-source library, Intel and Hugging Face will collaborate to build state-of-the-art hardware acceleration to train, fine-tune and predict with Transformers. Transformer models are increasingly large and complex, which can cause production challenges for latency-sensitive applications like search or chatbots. Unfortunately, latency optimization has long been a hard problem for Machine Learning (ML) practitioners. Even with deep knowledge of the underlying framework and hardware platform, it takes a lot of trial and error to figure out which knobs and features to leverage. Intel provides a complete foundation for accelerated AI with the Intel Xeon Scalable CPU platform and a wide range of hardware-optimized AI software tools, frameworks, and libraries. Thus, it made perfect sense for Hugging Face and Intel to join forces and collaborate on building powerful model optimization tools that let users achieve the best performance, scale, and productivity on Intel platforms. “\\*We’re excited to work with Hugging Face to bring the latest innovations of Intel Xeon hardware and Intel AI software to the Transformers community, through open source integration and integrated developer experiences.\\*”, says Wei Li, Intel Vice President & General Manager, AI and Analytics. In recent months, Intel and Hugging Face collaborated on scaling Transformer workloads. We published detailed tuning guides and benchmarks on inference ([part 1](https://huggingface.co/blog/bert-cpu-scaling-part-1), [part 2](https://huggingface.co/blog/bert-cpu-scaling-part-2)) and achieved [single-digit millisecond latency](https://huggingface.co/blog/infinity-cpu-performance) for DistilBERT on the latest Intel Xeon Ice Lake CPUs. On the training side, we added support for [Habana Gaudi](https://huggingface.co/blog/getting-started-habana) accelerators, which deliver up to 40% better price-performance than GPUs. The next logical step was to expand on this work and share it with the ML community. Enter the [Optimum Intel](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel) open source library! Let’s take a deeper look at it. ## Get Peak Transformers Performance with Optimum Intel\n[Optimum](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum) is an open-source library created by Hugging Face to simplify Transformer acceleration across a growing range of training and inference devices.""]",The name of the open-source library created by Hugging Face to simplify Transformer acceleration is **Optimum**.,Optimum
"What parameter is used to ensure that elements in a row have the same height in Gradio?
","[""Controlling Layout\nBy default, Components in Blocks are arranged vertically. Let's take a look at how we can rearrange Components. Under the hood, this layout structure uses the [flexbox model of web development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS\\_Flexible\\_Box\\_Layout/Basic\\_Concepts\\_of\\_Flexbox). ## Rows\nElements within a `with gr.Row` clause will all be displayed horizontally. For example, to display two Buttons side by side:\n```python\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\nwith gr.Row():\nbtn1 = gr.Button(\""Button 1\"")\nbtn2 = gr.Button(\""Button 2\"")\n```\nTo make every element in a Row have the same height, use the `equal\\_height` argument of the `style` method. ```python\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\nwith gr.Row(equal\\_height=True):\ntextbox = gr.Textbox()\nbtn2 = gr.Button(\""Button 2\"")\n```\nThe widths of elements in a Row can be controlled via a combination of `scale` and `min\\_width` arguments that are present in every Component. - `scale` is an integer that defines how an element will take up space in a Row. If scale is set to `0`, and element will not expand to take up space. If scale is set to `1` or greater, the element well expand. Multiple elements in a row will expand proportional to their scale. Below, `btn1` will expand twice as much as `btn2`, while `btn0` will not expand at all:\n```python\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\nwith gr.Row():\nbtn0 = gr.Button(\""Button 0\"", scale=0)\nbtn1 = gr.Button(\""Button 1\"", scale=1)\nbtn2 = gr.Button(\""Button 2\"", scale=2)\n```\n- `min\\_width` will set the minimum width the element will take."", ""The Row will wrap if there isn't sufficient space to satisfy all `min\\_width` values. Learn more about Rows in the [docs](https://gradio.app/docs/#row). ## Columns and Nesting\nComponents within a Column will be placed vertically atop each other. Since the vertical layout is the default layout for Blocks apps anyway, to be useful, Columns are usually nested within Rows. For example:\n$code\\_rows\\_and\\_columns\n$demo\\_rows\\_and\\_columns\nSee how the first column has two Textboxes arranged vertically. The second column has an Image and Button arranged vertically. Notice how the relative widths of the two columns is set by the `scale` parameter. The column with twice the `scale` value takes up twice the width. Learn more about Columns in the [docs](https://gradio.app/docs/#column). # Dimensions\nYou can control the height and width of various components, where the parameters are available. These parameters accept either a number (interpreted as pixels) or a string. Using a string allows the direct application of any CSS unit to the encapsulating Block element, catering to more specifc design requirements. When omitted, Gradio uses default dimensions suited for most use cases. Below is an example illustrating the use of viewport width (vw):\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\nim = gr.ImageEditor(\nwidth=\""50vw\"",\n)\ndemo.launch()\n```\nWhen using percentage values for dimensions, you may want to define a parent component with an absolute unit (e.g. `px` or `vw`). This approach ensures that child components with relative dimensions are sized appropriately:\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\ncss = \""\""\""\n.container {\nheight: 100vh;\n}\n\""\""\""\nwith gr.Blocks(css=css) as demo:\nwith gr.Column(elem\\_classes=[\""container\""]):\nname = gr.Chatbot(value=[[\""1\"", \""2\""]], height=\""70%\"")\ndemo.launch()\n```\nIn this example, the Column layout component is given a height of 100% of the viewport height (100vh), and the Chatbot component inside it takes up 70% of the Column's height."", ""Gradio Demo: blocks\\_group\n```\n!pip install -q gradio\n```\n```\nimport gradio as gr\ndef greet(name):\nreturn \""Hello \"" + name + \""!\""\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\ngr.Markdown(\""### This is a couple of elements without any gr.Group.

Now, let's accelerate! ## Optimum Intel and OpenVINO\n[Optimum Intel](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/index) accelerates end-to-end pipelines on Intel architectures.

Optimum Intel and OpenVINO can be installed as follows:\n```\npip install optimum[openvino]\n```\nStarting from the code above, we only need to replace `StableDiffusionPipeline` with `OVStableDiffusionPipeline`. To load a PyTorch model and convert it to the OpenVINO format on-the-fly, you can set `export=True` when loading your model. ```python\nfrom optimum.intel.openvino import OVStableDiffusionPipeline\n... ov\\_pipe = OVStableDiffusionPipeline.from\\_pretrained(model\\_id, export=True)\nlatency = elapsed\\_time(ov\\_pipe, prompt)\nprint(latency)\n# Don't forget to save the exported model\nov\\_pipe.save\\_pretrained(\""./openvino\"")\n```\nOpenVINO automatically optimizes the model for the `bfloat16` format. Thanks to this, the average latency is now \\*\\*16.7 seconds\\*\\*, a sweet 2x speedup. The pipeline above support dynamic input shapes, with no restriction on the number of images or their resolution. With Stable Diffusion, your application is usually restricted to one (or a few) different output resolutions, such as 512x512, or 256x256."", ""--\ntitle: \""Accelerate your models with 🤗 Optimum Intel and OpenVINO\""\nthumbnail: /blog/assets/113\\_openvino/thumbnail.png\nauthors:\n- user: echarlaix\n- user: juliensimon\n---\n# Accelerate your models with 🤗 Optimum Intel and OpenVINO\n![image](assets/113\\_openvino/thumbnail.png)\nLast July, we [announced](https://huggingface.co/blog/intel) that Intel and Hugging Face would collaborate on building state-of-the-art yet simple hardware acceleration tools for Transformer models. ​\nToday, we are very happy to announce that we added Intel [OpenVINO](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/index.html) to [Optimum Intel](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel).
