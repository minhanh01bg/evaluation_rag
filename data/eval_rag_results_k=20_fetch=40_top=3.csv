It's the first paper that successfully trains a Transformer encoder on ImageNet, attaining\nvery good results compared to familiar convolutional architectures. ViT hybrid is a slight variant of the [plain Vision Transformer](vit),\nby leveraging a convolutional backbone (specifically, [BiT](bit)) whose features are used as initial \""tokens\"" for the Transformer."", ""The abstract from the paper is the following:\n\\*Mobile vision transformers (MobileViT) can achieve state-of-the-art performance across several mobile vision tasks, including classification and detection. Though these models have fewer parameters, they have high latency as compared to convolutional neural network-based models. The main efficiency bottleneck in MobileViT is the multi-headed self-attention (MHA) in transformers, which requires O(k2) time complexity with respect to the number of tokens (or patches) k. Moreover, MHA requires costly operations (e.g., batch-wise matrix multiplication) for computing self-attention, impacting latency on resource-constrained devices. This paper introduces a separable self-attention method with linear complexity, i.e. O(k). A simple yet effective characteristic of the proposed method is that it uses element-wise operations for computing self-attention, making it a good choice for resource-constrained devices. The improved model, MobileViTV2, is state-of-the-art on several mobile vision tasks, including ImageNet object classification and MS-COCO object detection. With about three million parameters, MobileViTV2 achieves a top-1 accuracy of 75.6% on the ImageNet dataset, outperforming MobileViT by about 1% while running 3.2× faster on a mobile device.\\*\nThis model was contributed by [shehan97](https://huggingface.co/shehan97). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/apple/ml-cvnets). ## Usage tips\n- MobileViTV2 is more like a CNN than a Transformer model."", ""With so many Transformer variants available, it can be easy to miss the bigger picture. What all these models have in common is they're based on the original Transformer architecture. Some models only use the encoder or decoder, while others use both. This provides a useful taxonomy to categorize and examine the high-level differences within models in the Transformer family, and it'll help you understand Transformers you haven't encountered before. If you aren't familiar with the original Transformer model or need a refresher, check out the [How do Transformers work](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/4?fw=pt) chapter from the Hugging Face course.## Computer vision\n### Convolutional network\nFor a long time, convolutional networks (CNNs) were the dominant paradigm for computer vision tasks until the [Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) demonstrated its scalability and efficiency. Even then, some of a CNN's best qualities, like translation invariance, are so powerful (especially for certain tasks) that some Transformers incorporate convolutions in their architecture. [ConvNeXt](model\\_doc/convnext) flipped this exchange around and incorporated design choices from Transformers to modernize a CNN. For example, ConvNeXt uses non-overlapping sliding windows to patchify an image and a larger kernel to increase its global receptive field. ConvNeXt also makes several layer design choices to be more memory-efficient and improve performance, so it competes favorably with Transformers! ### Encoder[[cv-encoder]]\nThe [Vision Transformer (ViT)](model\\_doc/vit) opened the door to computer vision tasks without convolutions. ViT uses a standard Transformer encoder, but its main breakthrough was how it treated an image. It splits an image into fixed-size patches and uses them to create an embedding, just like how a sentence is split into tokens. ViT capitalized on the Transformers' efficient architecture to demonstrate competitive results with the CNNs at the time while requiring fewer resources to train. ViT was soon followed by other vision models that could also handle dense vision tasks like segmentation as well as detection. One of these models is the [Swin](model\\_doc/swin) Transformer. It builds hierarchical feature maps (like a CNN 👀 and unlike ViT) from smaller-sized patches and merges them with neighboring patches in deeper layers. Attention is only computed within a local window, and the window is shifted between attention layers to create connections to help the model learn better. Since the Swin Transformer can produce hierarchical feature maps, it is a good candidate for dense prediction tasks like segmentation and detection. The [SegFormer](model\\_doc/segformer) also uses a Transformer encoder to build hierarchical feature maps, but it adds a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) decoder on top to combine all the feature maps and make a prediction. Other vision models, like BeIT and ViTMAE, drew inspiration from BERT's pretraining objective. [BeIT](model\\_doc/beit) is pretrained by \\*masked image modeling (MIM)\\*; the image patches are randomly masked, and the image is also tokenized into visual tokens. BeIT is trained to predict the visual tokens corresponding to the masked patches. [ViTMAE](model\\_doc/vitmae) has a similar pretraining objective, except it must predict the pixels instead of visual tokens.""]","The hybrid Vision Transformer (ViT) model was proposed by Alexey Dosovitskiy, Lucas Beyer, Alexander Kolesnikov, Dirk Weissenborn, Xiaohua Zhai, Thomas Unterthiner, Mostafa Dehghani, Matthias Minderer, Georg Heigold, Sylvain Gelly, Jakob Uszkoreit, and Neil Houlsby.","Alexey Dosovitskiy, Lucas Beyer, Alexander Kolesnikov, Dirk Weissenborn, Xiaohua Zhai, Thomas Unterthiner, Mostafa Dehghani, Matthias Minderer, Georg Heigold, Sylvain Gelly, Jakob Uszkoreit, Neil Houlsby."
Who are the authors of the Longformer paper?,"[""The Authors' code can be found [here](https://github.com/allenai/longformer). ## Usage tips\n- Since the Longformer is based on RoBERTa, it doesn't have `token\\_type\\_ids`. You don't need to indicate which\ntoken belongs to which segment. Just separate your segments with the separation token `tokenizer.sep\\_token` (or\n``). - A transformer model replacing the attention matrices by sparse matrices to go faster. Often, the local context (e.g., what are the two tokens left and right?) is enough to take action for a given token. Some preselected input tokens are still given global attention, but the attention matrix has way less parameters, resulting in a speed-up. See the local attention section for more information. ## Longformer Self Attention\nLongformer self attention employs self attention on both a \""local\"" context and a \""global\"" context. Most tokens only\nattend \""locally\"" to each other meaning that each token attends to its \\\\(\\frac{1}{2} w\\\\) previous tokens and\n\\\\(\\frac{1}{2} w\\\\) succeeding tokens with \\\\(w\\\\) being the window length as defined in\n`config.attention\\_window`. Note that `config.attention\\_window` can be of type `List` to define a\ndifferent \\\\(w\\\\) for each layer. A selected few tokens attend \""globally\"" to all other tokens, as it is\nconventionally done for all tokens in `BertSelfAttention`. Note that \""locally\"" and \""globally\"" attending tokens are projected by different query, key and value matrices. Also note\nthat every \""locally\"" attending token not only attends to tokens within its window \\\\(w\\\\), but also to all \""globally\""\nattending tokens so that global attention is \\*symmetric\\*. The user can define which tokens attend \""locally\"" and which tokens attend \""globally\"" by setting the tensor\n`global\\_attention\\_mask` at run-time appropriately. All Longformer models employ the following logic for\n`global\\_attention\\_mask`:\n- 0: the token attends \""locally\"",\n- 1: the token attends \""globally\"". For more information please also refer to [`~LongformerModel.forward`] method. Using Longformer self attention, the memory and time complexity of the query-key matmul operation, which usually\nrepresents the memory and time bottleneck, can be reduced from \\\\(\\mathcal{O}(n\\_s \\times n\\_s)\\\\) to\n\\\\(\\mathcal{O}(n\\_s \\times w)\\\\), with \\\\(n\\_s\\\\) being the sequence length and \\\\(w\\\\) being the average window\nsize."", ""The abstract from the paper is the following:\n\\*Transformers have emerged as a powerful tool for a broad range of natural language processing tasks. A key component\nthat drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or\ndependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the\ninput sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences -- a topic being actively studied in the\ncommunity. To address this limitation, we propose Nyströmformer -- a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a\nfunction of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nyström method to approximate standard self-attention\nwith O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nyströmformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of\ntokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard\nsequence length, and find that our Nyströmformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than\nstandard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nyströmformer performs\nfavorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.

What is the style of TPU access when using Google Colab?,"[""### What kinds of TPU are available? New users are often very confused by the range of TPUs, and the different ways to access them. The first key distinction to understand is the difference between \\*\\*TPU Nodes\\*\\* and \\*\\*TPU VMs.\\*\\*\nWhen you use a \\*\\*TPU Node\\*\\*, you are effectively indirectly accessing a remote TPU. You will need a separate VM, which will initialize your network and data pipeline and then forward them to the remote node. When you use a TPU on Google Colab, you are accessing it in the \\*\\*TPU Node\\*\\* style. Using TPU Nodes can have some quite unexpected behaviour for people who aren’t used to them! In particular, because the TPU is located on a physically different system to the machine you’re running your Python code on, your data cannot be local to your machine - any data pipeline that loads from your machine’s internal storage will totally fail! Instead, data must be stored in Google Cloud Storage where your data pipeline can still access it, even when the pipeline is running on the remote TPU node. If you can fit all your data in memory as `np.ndarray` or `tf.Tensor`, then you can `fit()` on that data even when using Colab or a TPU Node, without needing to upload it to Google Cloud Storage. \\*\\*🤗Specific Hugging Face Tip🤗:\\*\\* The methods `Dataset.to\\_tf\\_dataset()` and its higher-level wrapper `model.prepare\\_tf\\_dataset()` , which you will see throughout our TF code examples, will both fail on a TPU Node. The reason for this is that even though they create a `tf.data.Dataset` it is not a “pure” `tf.data` pipeline and uses `tf.numpy\\_function` or `Dataset.from\\_generator()` to stream data from the underlying HuggingFace `Dataset`. This HuggingFace `Dataset` is backed by data that is on a local disc and which the remote TPU Node will not be able to read. The second way to access a TPU is via a \\*\\*TPU VM.\\*\\* When using a TPU VM, you connect directly to the machine that the TPU is attached to, much like training on a GPU VM. TPU VMs are generally easier to work with, particularly when it comes to your data pipeline. All of the above warnings do not apply to TPU VMs! This is an opinionated document, so here’s our opinion: \\*\\*Avoid using TPU Node if possible.\\*\\* It is more confusing and more difficult to debug than TPU VMs. It is also likely to be unsupported in future - Google’s latest TPU, TPUv4, can only be accessed as a TPU VM, which suggests that TPU Nodes are increasingly going to become a “legacy” access method. However, we understand that the only free TPU access is on Colab and Kaggle Kernels, which uses TPU Node - so we’ll try to explain how to handle it if you have to! Check the [TPU example notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/tpu\\_training-tf.ipynb) for code samples that explain this in more detail. ### What sizes of TPU are available? A single TPU (a v2-8/v3-8/v4-8) runs 8 replicas. TPUs exist in \\*\\*pods\\*\\* that can run hundreds or thousands of replicas simultaneously. When you use more than a single TPU but less than a whole pod (for example, a v3-32), your TPU fleet is referred to as a \\*\\*pod slice.\\*\\*\nWhen you access a free TPU via Colab, you generally get a single v2-8 TPU."", ""Here is the demo for running T5-11B. The T5-11B model checkpoint is in FP32 which uses 42GB of memory and does not fit on Google Colab.

With no performance degradation, it enables users with less compute to access models that were previously inaccessible. We've found several areas for improvement that can be worked on in the future to make this method even better for large models! ### Faster inference speed for smaller models\nAs we have seen in the [the benchmarking section](#is-it-faster-than-native-models), we could improve the runtime speed for small model (<=6B parameters) by a factor of almost 2x. However, while the inference speed is robust for large models like BLOOM-176B there are still improvements to be had for small models."", ""Introduction[[introduction]]\nWelcome to the Hugging Face course! This introduction will guide you through setting up a working environment. If you're just starting the course, we recommend you first take a look at [Chapter 1](/course/chapter1), then come back and set up your environment so you can try the code yourself. All the libraries that we'll be using in this course are available as Python packages, so here we'll show you how to set up a Python environment and install the specific libraries you'll need. We'll cover two ways of setting up your working environment, using a Colab notebook or a Python virtual environment. Feel free to choose the one that resonates with you the most. For beginners, we strongly recommend that you get started by using a Colab notebook. Note that we will not be covering the Windows system. If you're running on Windows, we recommend following along using a Colab notebook. If you're using a Linux distribution or macOS, you can use either approach described here. Most of the course relies on you having a Hugging Face account. We recommend creating one now: [create an account](https://huggingface.co/join). ## Using a Google Colab notebook[[using-a-google-colab-notebook]]\nUsing a Colab notebook is the simplest possible setup; boot up a notebook in your browser and get straight to coding! If you're not familiar with Colab, we recommend you start by following the [introduction](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb). Colab allows you to use some accelerating hardware, like GPUs or TPUs, and it is free for smaller workloads. Once you're comfortable moving around in Colab, create a new notebook and get started with the setup:\n\n![An empty colab notebook](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-course/documentation-images/resolve/main/en/chapter0/new_colab.png)\n\nThe next step is to install the libraries that we'll be using in this course. We'll use `pip` for the installation, which is the package manager for Python. In notebooks, you can run system commands by preceding them with the `!` character, so you can install the 🤗 Transformers library as follows:\n```\n!pip install transformers\n```\nYou can make sure the package was correctly installed by importing it within your Python runtime:\n```\nimport transformers\n```\n\n![A gif showing the result of the two commands above: installation and import](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-course/documentation-images/resolve/main/en/chapter0/install.gif)\n\nThis installs a very light version of 🤗 Transformers. In particular, no specific machine learning frameworks (like PyTorch or TensorFlow) are installed. Since we'll be using a lot of different features of the library, we recommend installing the development version, which comes with all the required dependencies for pretty much any imaginable use case:\n```\n!pip install transformers[sentencepiece]\n```\nThis will take a bit of time, but then you'll be ready to go for the rest of the course!""]","When using Google Colab, you are accessing a TPU in the **TPU Node** style.

What is the default label inferred by Gradio for the input parameter in the GUI?,"[""Gradio Components: The Key Concepts\nIn this section, we discuss a few important concepts when it comes to components in Gradio. It's important to understand these concepts when developing your own component. Otherwise, your component may behave very different to other Gradio components! Tip: You can skip this section if you are familiar with the internals of the Gradio library, such as each component's preprocess and postprocess methods. ## Interactive vs Static\nEvery component in Gradio comes in a `static` variant, and most come in an `interactive` version as well. The `static` version is used when a component is displaying a value, and the user can \\*\\*NOT\\*\\* change that value by interacting with it. The `interactive` version is used when the user is able to change the value by interacting with the Gradio UI. Let's see some examples:\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\ngr.Textbox(value=\""Hello\"", interactive=True)\ngr.Textbox(value=\""Hello\"", interactive=False)\ndemo.launch()\n```\nThis will display two textboxes. The only difference: you'll be able to edit the value of the Gradio component on top, and you won't be able to edit the variant on the bottom (i.e. the textbox will be disabled). Perhaps a more interesting example is with the `Image` component:\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\ngr.Image(interactive=True)\ngr.Image(interactive=False)\ndemo.launch()\n```\nThe interactive version of the component is much more complex -- you can upload images or snap a picture from your webcam -- while the static version can only be used to display images. Not every component has a distinct interactive version. For example, the `gr.AnnotatedImage` only appears as a static version since there's no way to interactively change the value of the annotations or the image. ### What you need to remember\n\\* Gradio will use the interactive version (if available) of a component if that component is used as the \\*\\*input\\*\\* to any event; otherwise, the static version will be used. \\* When you design custom components, you \\*\\*must\\*\\* accept the boolean interactive keyword in the constructor of your Python class. In the frontend, you \\*\\*may\\*\\* accept the `interactive` property, a `bool` which represents whether the component should be static or interactive. If you do not use this property in the frontend, the component will appear the same in interactive or static mode. ## The value and how it is preprocessed/postprocessed\nThe most important attribute of a component is its `value`."", ""Note: you can pass in a default value to the state parameter,\nwhich is used as the initial value of the state. ### Using interpretation to understand predictions[[using-interpretation-to-understand-predictions]]\nMost machine learning models are black boxes and the internal logic of the function is hidden from the end user. To encourage transparency, we've made it very easy to add interpretation to your model by simply setting the interpretation keyword in the Interface class to default. This allows your users to understand what parts of the input are responsible for the output. Take a look at the simple interface below which shows an image classifier that also includes interpretation:\n```py\nimport requests\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport gradio as gr\ninception\\_net = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2() # load the model\n# Download human-readable labels for ImageNet. response = requests.get(\""https://git.io/JJkYN\"")\nlabels = response.text.split(\""\\n\"")\ndef classify\\_image(inp):\ninp = inp.reshape((-1, 224, 224, 3))\ninp = tf.keras.applications.mobilenet\\_v2.preprocess\\_input(inp)\nprediction = inception\\_net.predict(inp).flatten()\nreturn {labels[i]: float(prediction[i]) for i in range(1000)}\nimage = gr.Image(shape=(224, 224))\nlabel = gr.Label(num\\_top\\_classes=3)\ntitle = \""Gradio Image Classifiction + Interpretation Example\""\ngr.Interface(\nfn=classify\\_image, inputs=image, outputs=label, interpretation=\""default\"", title=title\n).launch()\n```\nTest the interpretation function by submitting an input then clicking Interpret under the output component."", ""Besides the default interpretation method Gradio provides, you can also specify `shap` for the `interpretation` parameter and set the `num\\_shap` parameter. This uses Shapley-based interpretation, which you can read more about [here](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/shap.html). Lastly, you can also pass in your own interpretation function into the `interpretation` parameter. See an example in Gradio's getting started page [here](https://gradio.app/getting\\_started/). This wraps up our deep dive into the `Interface` class of Gradio. As we've seen, this class makes it simple to create machine learning demos in a few lines of Python code. However, sometimes you'll want to customise your demo by changing the layout or chaining multiple prediction functions together. Wouldn't it be nice if we could somehow split the `Interface` into customizable \""blocks\""? Fortunately, there is! That's the topic of the final section.""]","The default label inferred by Gradio for the input parameter in the GUI is ""Input"".",name

How do you register a custom Resnet model to the auto classes in Transformers?,"[""## Registering a model with custom code to the auto classes\nIf you are writing a library that extends 🤗 Transformers, you may want to extend the auto classes to include your own\nmodel. This is different from pushing the code to the Hub in the sense that users will need to import your library to\nget the custom models (contrarily to automatically downloading the model code from the Hub). As long as your config has a `model\\_type` attribute that is different from existing model types, and that your model\nclasses have the right `config\\_class` attributes, you can just add them to the auto classes like this:\n```py\nfrom transformers import AutoConfig, AutoModel, AutoModelForImageClassification\nAutoConfig.register(\""resnet\"", ResnetConfig)\nAutoModel.register(ResnetConfig, ResnetModel)\nAutoModelForImageClassification.register(ResnetConfig, ResnetModelForImageClassification)\n```\nNote that the first argument used when registering your custom config to [`AutoConfig`] needs to match the `model\\_type`\nof your custom config, and the first argument used when registering your custom models to any auto model class needs\nto match the `config\\_class` of those models."", ""## Writing a custom configuration\nBefore we dive into the model, let's first write its configuration. The configuration of a model is an object that\nwill contain all the necessary information to build the model. As we will see in the next section, the model can only\ntake a `config` to be initialized, so we really need that object to be as complete as possible. In our example, we will take a couple of arguments of the ResNet class that we might want to tweak. Different\nconfigurations will then give us the different types of ResNets that are possible. We then just store those arguments,\nafter checking the validity of a few of them. ```python\nfrom transformers import PretrainedConfig\nfrom typing import List\nclass ResnetConfig(PretrainedConfig):\nmodel\\_type = \""resnet\""\ndef \\_\\_init\\_\\_(\nself,\nblock\\_type=\""bottleneck\"",\nlayers: List[int] = [3, 4, 6, 3],\nnum\\_classes: int = 1000,\ninput\\_channels: int = 3,\ncardinality: int = 1,\nbase\\_width: int = 64,\nstem\\_width: int = 64,\nstem\\_type: str = \""\"",\navg\\_down: bool = False,\n\\*\\*kwargs,\n):\nif block\\_type not in [\""basic\"", \""bottleneck\""]:\nraise ValueError(f\""`block\\_type` must be 'basic' or bottleneck', got {block\\_type}.\"")\nif stem\\_type not in [\""\"", \""deep\"", \""deep-tiered\""]:\nraise ValueError(f\""`stem\\_type` must be '', 'deep' or 'deep-tiered', got {stem\\_type}.\"")\nself.block\\_type = block\\_type\nself.layers = layers\nself.num\\_classes = num\\_classes\nself.input\\_channels = input\\_channels\nself.cardinality = cardinality\nself.base\\_width = base\\_width\nself.stem\\_width = stem\\_width\nself.stem\\_type = stem\\_type\nself.avg\\_down = avg\\_down\nsuper().\\_\\_init\\_\\_(\\*\\*kwargs)\n```\nThe three important things to remember when writing you own configuration are the following:\n- you have to inherit from `PretrainedConfig`,\n- the `\\_\\_init\\_\\_` of your `PretrainedConfig` must accept any kwargs,\n- those `kwargs` need to be passed to the superclass `\\_\\_init\\_\\_`. The inheritance is to make sure you get all the functionality from the 🤗 Transformers library, while the two other\nconstraints come from the fact a `PretrainedConfig` has more fields than the ones you are setting. When reloading a\nconfig with the `from\\_pretrained` method, those fields need to be accepted by your config and then sent to the\nsuperclass. Defining a `model\\_type` for your configuration (here `model\\_type=\""resnet\""`) is not mandatory, unless you want to\nregister your model with the auto classes (see last section). With this done, you can easily create and save your configuration like you would do with any other model config of the\nlibrary. Here is how we can create a resnet50d config and save it:\n```py\nresnet50d\\_config = ResnetConfig(block\\_type=\""bottleneck\"", stem\\_width=32, stem\\_type=\""deep\"", avg\\_down=True)\nresnet50d\\_config.save\\_pretrained(\""custom-resnet\"")\n```\nThis will save a file named `config.json` inside the folder `custom-resnet`. You can then reload your config with the\n`from\\_pretrained` method:\n```py\nresnet50d\\_config = ResnetConfig.from\\_pretrained(\""custom-resnet\"")\n```\nYou can also use any other method of the [`PretrainedConfig`] class, like [`~PretrainedConfig.push\\_to\\_hub`] to\ndirectly upload your config to the Hub. ## Writing a custom model\nNow that we have our ResNet configuration, we can go on writing the model. We will actually write two: one that\nextracts the hidden features from a batch of images (like [`BertModel`]) and one that is suitable for image\nclassification (like [`BertForSequenceClassification`]). As we mentioned before, we'll only write a loose wrapper of the model to keep it simple for this example. The only\nthing we need to do before writing this class is a map between the block types and actual block classes. Then the\nmodel is defined from the configuration by passing everything to the `ResNet` class:\n```py\nfrom transformers import PreTrainedModel\nfrom timm.models.resnet import BasicBlock, Bottleneck, ResNet\nfrom .configuration\\_resnet import ResnetConfig\nBLOCK\\_MAPPING = {\""basic\"": BasicBlock, \""bottleneck\"": Bottleneck}\nclass ResnetModel(PreTrainedModel):\nconfig\\_class = ResnetConfig\ndef \\_\\_init\\_\\_(self, config):\nsuper().\\_\\_init\\_\\_(config)\nblock\\_layer = BLOCK\\_MAPPING[config.block\\_type]\nself.model = ResNet(\nblock\\_layer,\nconfig.layers,\nnum\\_classes=config.num\\_classes,\nin\\_chans=config.input\\_channels,\ncardinality=config.cardinality,\nbase\\_width=config.base\\_width,\nstem\\_width=config.stem\\_width,\nstem\\_type=config.stem\\_type,\navg\\_down=config.avg\\_down,\n)\ndef forward(self, tensor):\nreturn self.model.forward\\_features(tensor)\n```\nFor the model that will classify images, we just change the forward method:\n```py\nimport torch\nclass ResnetModelForImageClassification(PreTrainedModel):\nconfig\\_class = ResnetConfig\ndef \\_\\_init\\_\\_(self, config):\nsuper().\\_\\_init\\_\\_(config)\nblock\\_layer = BLOCK\\_MAPPING[config.block\\_type]\nself.model = ResNet(\nblock\\_layer,\nconfig.layers,\nnum\\_classes=config.num\\_classes,\nin\\_chans=config.input\\_channels,\ncardinality=config.cardinality,\nbase\\_width=config.base\\_width,\nstem\\_width=config.stem\\_width,\nstem\\_type=config.stem\\_type,\navg\\_down=config.avg\\_down,\n)\ndef forward(self, tensor, labels=None):\nlogits = self.model(tensor)\nif labels is not None:\nloss = torch.nn.cross\\_entropy(logits, labels)\nreturn {\""loss\"": loss, \""logits\"": logits}\nreturn {\""logits\"": logits}\n```\nIn both cases, notice how we inherit from `PreTrainedModel` and call the superclass initialization with the `config`\n(a bit like when you write a regular `torch.nn.Module`)."", ""You can check the result\nin this [model repo](https://huggingface.co/sgugger/custom-resnet50d). See the [sharing tutorial](model\\_sharing) for more information on the push to Hub method. ## Using a model with custom code\nYou can use any configuration, model or tokenizer with custom code files in its repository with the auto-classes and\nthe `from\\_pretrained` method. All files and code uploaded to the Hub are scanned for malware (refer to the [Hub security](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security#malware-scanning) documentation for more information), but you should still\nreview the model code and author to avoid executing malicious code on your machine.

1. Ensure that your configuration has a `model_type` attribute that is different from existing model types.
2. Make sure your model classes have the correct `config_class` attributes.
3. Use the `register` method to add your custom configuration and models to the auto classes.

Here is an example of how to do this:

```python
from transformers import AutoConfig, AutoModel, AutoModelForImageClassification

# Register the custom configuration
AutoConfig.register(""resnet"", ResnetConfig)

# Register the custom models
AutoModel.register(ResnetConfig, ResnetModel)
AutoModelForImageClassification.register(ResnetConfig, ResnetModelForImageClassification)

In this code:

- The first argument used when registering your custom models to any auto model class needs to match the `config_class` of those models.","Use AutoConfig.register(""resnet"", ResnetConfig), AutoModel.register(ResnetConfig, ResnetModel), and AutoModelForImageClassification.register(ResnetConfig, ResnetModelForImageClassification) to register the custom Resnet model to the auto classes."
Who is the author of the paper 'Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision'?,"[""It can be\ninstructed in natural language to predict the most relevant text snippet, given an image, without directly optimizing\nfor the task, similarly to the zero-shot capabilities of GPT-2 and 3. The abstract from the paper is the following:\n\\*State-of-the-art computer vision systems are trained to predict a fixed set of predetermined object categories. This\nrestricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify\nany other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a\nmuch broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes\nwith which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400\nmillion (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference\nlearned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study\nthe performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks\nsuch as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The\nmodel transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need\nfor any dataset specific training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet zero-shot\nwithout needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on. We release our code and pre-trained\nmodel weights at this https URL.\\*\nThis model was contributed by [valhalla](https://huggingface.co/valhalla). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/openai/CLIP). ## Usage tips and example\nCLIP is a multi-modal vision and language model. It can be used for image-text similarity and for zero-shot image\nclassification. CLIP uses a ViT like transformer to get visual features and a causal language model to get the text\nfeatures."", ""The model would have separate or fused encoders for vision and language to achieve this understanding. But these inputs and outputs can take several forms. Below we give some examples:\n- Image retrieval from natural language text. - Phrase grounding, i.e., performing object detection from an input image and natural language phrase (example: A \\*\\*young person\\*\\* swings a \\*\\*bat\\*\\*). - Visual question answering, i.e., finding answers from an input image and a question in natural language. - Generate a caption for a given image. This can also take the form of conditional text generation, where you'd start with a natural language prompt and an image. - Detection of hate speech from social media content involving both images and text modalities. ## Learning Strategies\nA vision-language model typically consists of 3 key elements: an image encoder, a text encoder, and a strategy to fuse information from the two encoders. These key elements are tightly coupled together as the loss functions are designed around both the model architecture and the learning strategy. While vision-language model research is hardly a new research area, the design of such models has changed tremendously over the years. Whereas earlier research adopted hand-crafted image descriptors and pre-trained word vectors or the frequency-based TF-IDF features, the latest research predominantly adopts image and text encoders with [transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) architectures to separately or jointly learn image and text features. These models are pre-trained with strategic pre-training objectives that enable various downstream tasks. In this section, we'll discuss some of the typical pre-training objectives and strategies for vision-language models that have been shown to perform well regarding their transfer performance. We'll also touch upon additional interesting things that are either specific to these objectives or can be used as general components for pre-training. We’ll cover the following themes in the pre-training objectives:\n- \\*\\*Contrastive Learning:\\*\\* Aligning images and texts to a joint feature space in a contrastive manner\n- \\*\\*PrefixLM:\\*\\* Jointly learning image and text embeddings by using images as a prefix to a language model\n- \\*\\*Multi-modal Fusing with Cross Attention:\\*\\* Fusing visual information into layers of a language model with a cross-attention mechanism\n- \\*\\*MLM / ITM:\\*\\* Aligning parts of images with text with masked-language modeling and image-text matching objectives\n- \\*\\*No Training:\\*\\* Using stand-alone vision and language models via iterative optimization\nNote that this section is a non-exhaustive list, and there are various other approaches, as well as hybrid strategies such as [Unified-IO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08916).

What is the purpose of local attention in Longformer?,"[""The Authors' code can be found [here](https://github.com/allenai/longformer). ## Usage tips\n- Since the Longformer is based on RoBERTa, it doesn't have `token\\_type\\_ids`. You don't need to indicate which\ntoken belongs to which segment. Just separate your segments with the separation token `tokenizer.sep\\_token` (or\n``). - A transformer model replacing the attention matrices by sparse matrices to go faster. Often, the local context (e.g., what are the two tokens left and right?) is enough to take action for a given token. Some preselected input tokens are still given global attention, but the attention matrix has way less parameters, resulting in a speed-up. See the local attention section for more information. ## Longformer Self Attention\nLongformer self attention employs self attention on both a \""local\"" context and a \""global\"" context. Most tokens only\nattend \""locally\"" to each other meaning that each token attends to its \\\\(\\frac{1}{2} w\\\\) previous tokens and\n\\\\(\\frac{1}{2} w\\\\) succeeding tokens with \\\\(w\\\\) being the window length as defined in\n`config.attention\\_window`. Note that `config.attention\\_window` can be of type `List` to define a\ndifferent \\\\(w\\\\) for each layer. A selected few tokens attend \""globally\"" to all other tokens, as it is\nconventionally done for all tokens in `BertSelfAttention`. Note that \""locally\"" and \""globally\"" attending tokens are projected by different query, key and value matrices. Also note\nthat every \""locally\"" attending token not only attends to tokens within its window \\\\(w\\\\), but also to all \""globally\""\nattending tokens so that global attention is \\*symmetric\\*. The user can define which tokens attend \""locally\"" and which tokens attend \""globally\"" by setting the tensor\n`global\\_attention\\_mask` at run-time appropriately. All Longformer models employ the following logic for\n`global\\_attention\\_mask`:\n- 0: the token attends \""locally\"",\n- 1: the token attends \""globally\"". For more information please also refer to [`~LongformerModel.forward`] method. Using Longformer self attention, the memory and time complexity of the query-key matmul operation, which usually\nrepresents the memory and time bottleneck, can be reduced from \\\\(\\mathcal{O}(n\\_s \\times n\\_s)\\\\) to\n\\\\(\\mathcal{O}(n\\_s \\times w)\\\\), with \\\\(n\\_s\\\\) being the sequence length and \\\\(w\\\\) being the average window\nsize."", ""This can adversely affect their ability to model long-range phenomena common in images, such as symmetry and occlusion, especially with a small number of layers. Growing the receptive field has been shown to improve quality significantly (Salimans et al.). Doing so, however, comes at a significant cost in number of parameters and consequently computational performance and can make training such models more challenging. >\n> ... self-attention can achieve a better balance in the trade-off between the virtually unlimited receptive field of the necessarily sequential PixelRNN and the limited receptive field of the much more parallelizable PixelCNN and its various extensions.

The transformer context is global but masked, because attention is provided over all previously predicted latent pixels, but the model is still AR so attention cannot be provided over not yet predicted pixels.

Peters, Arman Cohan. The abstract from the paper is the following:\n\\*Transformer-based models are unable to process long sequences due to their self-attention operation, which scales\nquadratically with the sequence length. To address this limitation, we introduce the Longformer with an attention\nmechanism that scales linearly with sequence length, making it easy to process documents of thousands of tokens or\nlonger. Longformer's attention mechanism is a drop-in replacement for the standard self-attention and combines a local\nwindowed attention with a task motivated global attention. Following prior work on long-sequence transformers, we\nevaluate Longformer on character-level language modeling and achieve state-of-the-art results on text8 and enwik8.""]","The purpose of local attention in Longformer is to allow each token to attend to a limited context of tokens around it, specifically to its \(\frac{1}{2} w\) previous tokens and \(\frac{1}{2} w\) succeeding tokens, where \(w\) is the window length defined in `config.attention_window`. This mechanism helps to reduce the memory and time complexity of the self-attention operation from \(\mathcal{O}(n_s \times n_s)\) to \(\mathcal{O}(n_s \times w)\), making it more efficient for processing long sequences. Local attention is particularly useful because it captures the immediate context of tokens, which is often sufficient for many tasks, while still allowing a few selected tokens to attend globally to all other tokens.","To take action for a given token using the local context, such as the two tokens to the left and right, and to build a representation of the whole sentence by stacking attention layers with a small window."

We won't dive into the specifics here, but we'll offer some further readings if you want to get a better understanding at what happens under the hood. So when should one use an encoder? Encoders can be used as standalone models in a wide variety of tasks. For example BERT, arguably the most famous transformer model, is a standalone encoder model and at the time of release, beat the state of the art in many sequence classification tasks, question answering tasks, and masked language modeling, to only cite a few. The idea is that encoders are very powerful at extracting vectors that carry meaningful information about a sequence. This vector can then be handled down the road by additional layers of neurons to make sense of them. Let's take a look at some examples where encoders really shine. First of all, Masked Language Modeling, or MLM. It's the task of predicting a hidden word in a sequence of words. Here, for example, we have hidden the word between \""My\"" and \""is\"". This is one of the objectives with which BERT was trained: it was trained to predict hidden words in a sequence. Encoders shine in this scenario in particular, as bidirectional information is crucial here. If we didn't have the words on the right (is, Sylvain, and the dot), then there is very little chance that BERT would have been able to identify \""name\"" as the correct word. The encoder needs to have a good understanding of the sequence in order to predict a masked word, as even if the text is grammatically correct, It does not necessarily make sense in the context of the sequence. As mentioned earlier, encoders are good at doing sequence classification. Sentiment analysis is an example of a sequence classification task. The model's aim is to identify the sentiment of a sequence – it can range from giving a sequence a rating from one to five stars if doing review analysis, to giving a positive or negative rating to a sequence, which is what is shown here. For example here, given the two sequences, we use the model to compute a prediction and to classify the sequences among these two classes: positive and negative. While the two sequences are very similar, containing the same words, the meaning is different – and the encoder model is able to grasp that difference."", ""Text Summarization with Pretrained Encoders\nThis folder contains part of the code necessary to reproduce the results on abstractive summarization from the article [Text Summarization with Pretrained Encoders](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08345.pdf) by [Yang Liu](https://nlp-yang.github.io/) and [Mirella Lapata](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/).

GPTQ compresses GPT (decoder) models by reducing the number of bits needed to store each weight in the model, from 32 bits down to just 3-4 bits. This means the model takes up much less memory and can run on less Hardware, e.g. Single GPU for 13B Llama2 models.

What is a potential legal issue with using outputs from language models?,"[""The prompts are passed through the initial language model to generate new text. Human annotators are used to rank the generated text outputs from the LM. One may initially think that humans should apply a scalar score directly to each piece of text in order to generate a reward model, but this is difficult to do in practice. The differing values of humans cause these scores to be uncalibrated and noisy. Instead, rankings are used to compare the outputs of multiple models and create a much better regularized dataset. There are multiple methods for ranking the text. One method that has been successful is to have users compare generated text from two language models conditioned on the same prompt. By comparing model outputs in head-to-head matchups, an [Elo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo\\_rating\\_system) system can be used to generate a ranking of the models and outputs relative to each-other. These different methods of ranking are normalized into a scalar reward signal for training. An interesting artifact of this process is that the successful RLHF systems to date have used reward language models with varying sizes relative to the text generation (e.g. OpenAI 175B LM, 6B reward model, Anthropic used LM and reward models from 10B to 52B, DeepMind uses 70B Chinchilla models for both LM and reward)."", ""4. \\*\\*Refine the content.\\*\\* I continue to refine the generated content to better fit the game. ![ChatGPT for Story #4](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/124_ml-for-games/chatgpt4.png)\n\nI'm happy with this result.

Given these limitations, the safest approach may be to use language models like ChatGPT for brainstorming but write the final content by hand."", ""n this video we take a look at the data processing necessary to train causal language models. Causal Language Modeling is the task of predicting the next token based on the previous token. Another term for Causal Language Modeling is Autoregressive Modeling. In the example that you see here the next token could for example be NLP or machine learning. A popular example of a Causal Language Model is the GPT family of models. To train such models such as GPT-2 we usually start with a large corpus of text files. These files can webpages scraped from the internet such as the Common Crawl dataset or they can be Python files from GitHub like you can see here. As a first step we need to tokenize these files such that we can feed them through a model. Here we show the tokenized texts as bars of various length illustrating the different sequence lengths. Normally, the text files come in various sizes and which results in various sequence length of the tokenized texts. Transformer models have a limited context length and depending on the data source it is possible that the tokenized texts are much longer than this context length. In this case we could just truncate the sequence to the context length but this would mean that we loose everything after the context length. Using the return overflowing tokens flag in the we can use the tokenizer to create chunks with each one being the size of the context length. Sometimes it can happen that the last chunk is too short if there aren’t enough tokens to fill it. In this case we would like to remove it. With the return\\_length keyword we also get the length of each chunk from the tokenizer. This function shows all the steps necessary to prepare the dataset. First we tokenize the dataset with the flags I just mentioned. Then we go through each chunk and if its length matches the context length we add it to the inputs we return. We can apply this function to the whole dataset and we make sure to use batches and remove the existing columns. We need to remove columns because we can create multiple samples per text and the shapes in the dataset would not match.""]","A potential legal issue with using outputs from language models is that the legal landscape surrounding Generative AI is currently very unclear, with several ongoing lawsuits.

What is the filename used when downloading the model from the Hugging Face Hub?,"[""n this video, we're going to understand how to manage a model repository on the HuggingFace model hub. In order to handle a repository, you should first have a Hugging Face account. A link to create a new account is available in the description. Once you are logged in, you can create a new repository by clicking on the \""New model\"" option. You should be facing a similar modal to the following. In the \""Owner\"" input, you can put either your own namespace or any of your organisations namespaces. The model name is the model identifier that will then be used to identify your model on your chosen namespace. The final choice is between public and private. Public models are accessible by anyone. This is the recommended, free option, as this makes your model easily accessible and shareable. The owners of your namespace are the only ones who can update and change your model. A more advanced option is the private option. In this case, only the owners of your namespace will have visibility over your model. Other users won't know it exists and will not be able to use it. Let's create a dummy model to play with. Once your model is created, comes the management of that model! Three tabs are available to you. You're facing the first one, which is the model card page; this is the page used to showcase your model to the world."", ""!--⚠️ Note that this file is in Markdown but contain specific syntax for our doc-builder (similar to MDX) that may not be\nrendered properly in your Markdown viewer. -->\n# Manage `huggingface\\_hub` cache-system\n## Understand caching\nThe Hugging Face Hub cache-system is designed to be the central cache shared across libraries\nthat depend on the Hub. It has been updated in v0.8.0 to prevent re-downloading same files\nbetween revisions. The caching system is designed as follows:\n```\n├─ \n├─ \n├─ \n```\nThe `` is usually your user's home directory. However, it is customizable with the `cache\\_dir` argument on all methods, or by specifying either `HF\\_HOME` or `HF\\_HUB\\_CACHE` environment variable. Models, datasets and spaces share a common root. Each of these repositories contains the\nrepository type, the namespace (organization or username) if it exists and the\nrepository name:\n```\n├─ models--julien-c--EsperBERTo-small\n├─ models--lysandrejik--arxiv-nlp\n├─ models--bert-base-cased\n├─ datasets--glue\n├─ datasets--huggingface--DataMeasurementsFiles\n├─ spaces--dalle-mini--dalle-mini\n```\nIt is within these folders that all files will now be downloaded from the Hub. Caching ensures that\na file isn't downloaded twice if it already exists and wasn't updated; but if it was updated,\nand you're asking for the latest file, then it will download the latest file (while keeping\nthe previous file intact in case you need it again). In order to achieve this, all folders contain the same skeleton:\n```\n├─ datasets--glue\n│ ├─ refs\n│ ├─ blobs\n│ ├─ snapshots\n... ```\nEach folder is designed to contain the following:\n### Refs\nThe `refs` folder contains files which indicates the latest revision of the given reference. For example,\nif we have previously fetched a file from the `main` branch of a repository, the `refs`\nfolder will contain a file named `main`, which will itself contain the commit identifier of the current head. If the latest commit of `main` has `aaaaaa` as identifier, then it will contain `aaaaaa`. If that same branch gets updated with a new commit, that has `bbbbbb` as an identifier, then\nre-downloading a file from that reference will update the `refs/main` file to contain `bbbbbb`. ### Blobs\nThe `blobs` folder contains the actual files that we have downloaded. The name of each file is their hash. ### Snapshots\nThe `snapshots` folder contains symlinks to the blobs mentioned above. It is itself made up of several folders:\none per known revision! In the explanation above, we had initially fetched a file from the `aaaaaa` revision, before fetching a file from\nthe `bbbbbb` revision. In this situation, we would now have two folders in the `snapshots` folder: `aaaaaa`\nand `bbbbbb`. In each of these folders, live symlinks that have the names of the files that we have downloaded. For example,\nif we had downloaded the `README.md` file at revision `aaaaaa`, we would have the following path:\n```\n//snapshots/aaaaaa/README.md\n```\nThat `README.md` file is actually a symlink linking to the blob that has the hash of the file. By creating the skeleton this way we open the mechanism to file sharing: if the same file was fetched in\nrevision `bbbbbb`, it would have the same hash and the file would not need to be re-downloaded. ### .no\\_exist (advanced)\nIn addition to the `blobs`, `refs` and `snapshots` folders, you might also find a `.no\\_exist` folder\nin your cache. This folder keeps track of files that you've tried to download once but don't exist\non the Hub. Its structure is the same as the `snapshots` folder with 1 subfolder per known revision:\n```\n//.no\\_exist/aaaaaa/config\\_that\\_does\\_not\\_exist.json\n```\nUnlike the `snapshots` folder, files are simple empty files (no symlinks). In this example,\nthe file `\""config\\_that\\_does\\_not\\_exist.json\""` does not exist on the Hub for the revision `\""aaaaaa\""`. As it only stores empty files, this folder is neglectable is term of disk usage. So now you might wonder, why is this information even relevant? In some cases, a framework tries to load optional files for a model. Saving the non-existence\nof optional files makes it faster to load a model as it saves 1 HTTP call per possible optional file. This is for example the case in `transformers` where each tokenizer can support additional files. The first time you load the tokenizer on your machine, it will cache which optional files exists (and\nwhich doesn't) to make the loading time faster for the next initializations. To test if a file is cached locally (without making any HTTP request), you can use the [`try\\_to\\_load\\_from\\_cache`]\nhelper. It will either return the filepath (if exists and cached), the object `\\_CACHED\\_NO\\_EXIST` (if non-existence\nis cached) or `None` (if we don't know). ```python\nfrom huggingface\\_hub import try\\_to\\_load\\_from\\_cache, \\_CACHED\\_NO\\_EXIST\nfilepath = try\\_to\\_load\\_from\\_cache()\nif isinstance(filepath, str):\n# file exists and is cached\n... elif filepath is \\_CACHED\\_NO\\_EXIST:\n# non-existence of file is cached\n... else:\n# file is not cached\n... ```\n### In practice\nIn practice, your cache should look like the following tree:\n```text\n[ 96] . └── [ 160] models--julien-c--EsperBERTo-small\n├── [ 160] blobs\n│ ├── [321M] 403450e234d65943a7dcf7e05a771ce3c92faa84dd07db4ac20f592037a1e4bd\n│ ├── [ 398] 7cb18dc9bafbfcf74629a4b760af1b160957a83e\n│ └── [1.4K] d7edf6bd2a681fb0175f7735299831ee1b22b812\n├── [ 96] refs\n│ └── [ 40] main\n└── [ 128] snapshots\n├── [ 128] 2439f60ef33a0d46d85da5001d52aeda5b00ce9f\n│ ├── [ 52] README.md -> ../../blobs/d7edf6bd2a681fb0175f7735299831ee1b22b812\n│ └── [ 76] pytorch\\_model.bin -> ../../blobs/403450e234d65943a7dcf7e05a771ce3c92faa84dd07db4ac20f592037a1e4bd\n└── [ 128] bbc77c8132af1cc5cf678da3f1ddf2de43606d48\n├── [ 52] README.md -> ../../blobs/7cb18dc9bafbfcf74629a4b760af1b160957a83e\n└── [ 76] pytorch\\_model.bin -> ../../blobs/403450e234d65943a7dcf7e05a771ce3c92faa84dd07db4ac20f592037a1e4bd\n```\n### Limitations\nIn order to have an efficient cache-system, `huggingface-hub` uses symlinks."", ""Models Download Stats\n## How are download stats generated for models? Counting the number of downloads for models is not a trivial task as a single model repository might contain multiple files, including multiple model weight files (e.g., with sharded models), and different formats depending on the library. To avoid double counting downloads (e.g., counting a single download of a model as multiple downloads), the Hub uses a set of query files that are employed for download counting. No information is sent from the user, and no additional calls are made for this. The count is done server-side as we serve files for downloads. Every HTTP request to these files, including `GET` and `HEAD` will be counted as a download. By default, when no library is specified, the Hub uses `config.json` as the default query file. Otherwise, the query file depends on each library, and the Hub might examine files such as `pytorch\\_model.bin` and `adapter\\_config.json`. ## Which are the query files for different libraries?

What tool can be used for sentiment analysis in NLP?,"[""### Finding suitable datasets\nHaving decided on the task, next, we should find the data the model will be trained on. This is usually more important for the performance of your use case than picking the right model architecture. Keep in mind that a model is \\*\\*only as good as the data it has been trained on\\*\\*. Thus, we should be very careful when curating and/or selecting the dataset. Since we consider the hypothetical use case of \\*filtering out unsatisfied messages\\*, let's look into what datasets are available. For your real-world use case, it is \\*\\*very likely\\*\\* that you have internal data that best represents the actual data your NLP system is supposed to handle. Therefore, you should use such internal data to train your NLP system. It can nevertheless be helpful to also include publicly available data to improve the generalizability of your model. Let's take a look at all available Datasets on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets). On the left side, you can filter the datasets according to \\*Task Categories\\* as well as \\*Tasks\\* which are more specific.

We are left with \\*ca.\\* 80 datasets at the time of writing this notebook. Two aspects should be evaluated when picking a dataset:\n- \\*\\*Quality\\*\\*: Is the dataset of high quality? More specifically: Does the data correspond to the data you expect to deal with in your use case? Is the data diverse, unbiased, ...? - \\*\\*Size\\*\\*: How big is the dataset? Usually, one can safely say the bigger the dataset, the better. It's quite tricky to evaluate whether a dataset is of high quality efficiently, and it's even more challenging to know whether and how the dataset is biased. An efficient and reasonable heuristic for high quality is to look at the download statistics."", ""💥\nAre you interested in doing more?

It is a Graph Transformer model, modified to allow computations on graphs instead of text sequences by generating embeddings and features of interest during preprocessing and collation, then using a modified attention. The abstract from the paper is the following:\n\\*The Transformer architecture has become a dominant choice in many domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision. Yet, it has not achieved competitive performance on popular leaderboards of graph-level prediction compared to mainstream GNN variants. Therefore, it remains a mystery how Transformers could perform well for graph representation learning. In this paper, we solve this mystery by presenting Graphormer, which is built upon the standard Transformer architecture, and could attain excellent results on a broad range of graph representation learning tasks, especially on the recent OGB Large-Scale Challenge. Our key insight to utilizing Transformer in the graph is the necessity of effectively encoding the structural information of a graph into the model. To this end, we propose several simple yet effective structural encoding methods to help Graphormer better model graph-structured data. Besides, we mathematically characterize the expressive power of Graphormer and exhibit that with our ways of encoding the structural information of graphs, many popular GNN variants could be covered as the special cases of Graphormer.\\*\nThis model was contributed by [clefourrier](https://huggingface.co/clefourrier). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/Graphormer). ## Usage tips\nThis model will not work well on large graphs (more than 100 nodes/edges), as it will make the memory explode. You can reduce the batch size, increase your RAM, or decrease the `UNREACHABLE\\_NODE\\_DISTANCE` parameter in algos\\_graphormer.pyx, but it will be hard to go above 700 nodes/edges.

What function does Accelerate provide to determine a device map?,"[""upercharge your Pytorch training loop with Hugging Face Accelerate. There are multiple setups on which you can run your training: it could be on CPU, GPUs, TPUs. Distributed on one machine with several devices, or several machines (often called nodes) each with multiple devices. On top of that there are new tweaks to make your training faster or more memory efficient, like mixed precision and DeepSpeed. Each of those setups or training tweaks, requires you to change the code of your training loop in one way or another and to learn a new API. All those setups are handled by the Trainer API, and there are several third-party libraries that can also help you with that. The problem with those is that they can feel like a black box and that it might not be easy to implement the tweak to the training loop you need. Accelerate has been designed specifically to let you retain full control over your training loop and be as non-intrusive as possible. With just four lines to add to your training loop (here shown on the code of the training loop from the \""Raw training loop\"" video), Accelerate will handle all the setups and training tweaks mentioned on the first slide."", ""Now let's talk about Accelerate, a library aimed to make this process more seameless and also help with a few best practices\n## 🤗 Accelerate\n[Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate) is a library designed to allow you to perform what we just did above, without needing to modify your code greatly. On top of this, the data pipeline innate to Accelerate can also improve performance to your code as well. First, let's wrap all of the above code we just performed into a single function, to help us visualize the difference:\n```python\ndef train\\_ddp(rank, world\\_size):\nsetup(rank, world\\_size)\n# Build DataLoaders\ntransform = transforms.Compose([\ntransforms.ToTensor(),\ntransforms.Normalize((0.1307), (0.3081))\n])\ntrain\\_dset = datasets.MNIST('data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)\ntest\\_dset = datasets.MNIST('data', train=False, transform=transform)\ntrain\\_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train\\_dset, shuffle=True, batch\\_size=64)\ntest\\_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(test\\_dset, shuffle=False, batch\\_size=64)\n# Build model\nmodel = model.to(rank)\nddp\\_model = DDP(model, device\\_ids=[rank])\n# Build optimizer\noptimizer = optim.AdamW(ddp\\_model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)\n# Train for a single epoch\nmodel.train()\nfor batch\\_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(train\\_loader):\ndata, target = data.to(device), target.to(device)\noutput = model(data)\nloss = F.nll\\_loss(output, target)\nloss.backward()\noptimizer.step()\noptimizer.zero\\_grad()\n# Evaluate\nmodel.eval()\ncorrect = 0\nwith torch.no\\_grad():\nfor data, target in test\\_loader:\ndata, target = data.to(device), target.to(device)\noutput = model(data)\npred = output.argmax(dim=1, keepdim=True)\ncorrect += pred.eq(target.view\\_as(pred)).sum().item()\nprint(f'Accuracy: {100."", ""The attribute `has\\_fp16\\_weights` has to be set to `False` in order to directly load the weights in `int8` together with the quantization statistics. We also discard the replacement for some modules (here the `lm\\_head`) since we want to keep the latest in their native precision for more precise and stable results. But it isn't over yet! The function above is executed under the `init\\_empty\\_weights` context manager which means that the new model will be still in the `meta` device. For models that are initialized under this context manager, `accelerate` will manually load the parameters of each module and move them to the correct devices. In `bitsandbytes`, setting a `Linear8bitLt` module's device is a crucial step (if you are curious, you can check the code snippet [here](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes/blob/bd515328d70f344f935075f359c5aefc616878d5/bitsandbytes/nn/modules.py#L94)) as we have seen in our toy script. Here the quantization step fails when calling it twice.

What is the latency in milliseconds with fp16 optimization?,"[""The impact of `fp16` on latency is less marked with `batch\\_size = 1`, but here it is of enormous interest as it can reduce latency by almost half, and almost double throughput! # Concluding remarks\nThis blog post showcased a few simple optimization tricks bundled in the 🤗 ecosystem. Using anyone of these techniques, or a combination of all three, can greatly improve Bark inference speed and memory footprint. \\* You can use the large version of Bark without any performance degradation and a footprint of just 2GB instead of 5GB, 15% faster, \\*\\*using 🤗 Better Transformer and CPU offload\\*\\*. \\* Do you prefer high throughput? \\*\\*Batch by 8 with 🤗 Better Transformer and half-precision\\*\\*. \\* You can get the best of both worlds by using \\*\\*fp16, 🤗 Better Transformer and CPU offload\\*\\*!"", ""Also, it is important to note that tuning OpenMP library will only work within software that uses the OpenMP API internally. More specially, now only PyTorch and TorchScript really make usage of OpenMP and thus benefit from OpenMP backend tuning. This also explains why we reported latencies only for these two frameworks. ## Automatic Performances Tuning: Bayesian Optimization with Intel SigOpt\nAs mentioned above, many knobs can be tweaked to improve latency and throughput on Intel CPUs, but because there are many, tuning all of them to get optimal performance can be cumbersome. For instance, in our experiments, the following knobs were tuned:\n- The number of cores: although using as many cores as you have is often a good idea, it does not always provide the best performance because it also means more communication between the different threads. On top of that, having better performance with fewer cores can be very useful as it allows to run multiple instances at the same time, resulting in both better latency and throughput. - The memory allocator: which memory allocator out of the default malloc, Google's tcmalloc and Facebook's jemalloc provides the best performance? - The parallelism library: which parallelism library out of GNU OpenMP and Intel OpenMP provides the best performance? - Transparent Huge Pages: does enabling Transparent Huge Pages (THP) on the system provide better performance? - KMP block time parameter: sets the time, in milliseconds, that a thread should wait, after completing the execution of a parallel region, before sleeping. Of course, the brute force approach, consisting of trying out all the possibilities will provide the best knob values to use to get optimal performance but,\nthe size of the search space being `N x 3 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 24N`, it can take a lot of time: on a machine with 80 physical cores, this means trying out at most `24 x 80 = 1920` different setups! 😱\nFortunately, Intel's [SigOpt](https://sigopt.com/), through Bayesian optimization, allows us to make these tuning experiments both faster and more convenient to analyse, while providing similar performance than the brute force approach. When we analyse the relative difference between the absolute best latency and what SigOpt provides, we observe that although it is often not as good as brute force (except for sequence length = 512 in that specific case),\nit gives very close performance, with \\*\\*8.6%\\*\\* being the biggest gap on this figure. |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Figure 23. Absolute best latency found by SigOpt automatic tuning vs brute force | Figure 24. Relative best latency found by SigOpt automatic tuning vs brute force |\n\nSigOpt is also very useful for analysis: it provides a lot of figures and valuable information."", ""First Token Latency (also known as Time to First Token or prefill latency) measures how long you wait from the time you enter your prompt to the time you begin receiving your output, so this metric can tell you how responsive the model will feel.

Time it takes to generate the first token (ms)\n\nThroughput, on the other hand, measures how fast the model can generate tokens and is particularly relevant when you want to batch generations together.

As H200 GPUs become more readily available, we will share performance data for Optimum-NVIDIA running on them. ### Next steps\nOptimum-NVIDIA currently provides peak performance for the LLaMAForCausalLM architecture + task, so any [LLaMA-based model](https://huggingface.co/models?other=llama,llama2), including fine-tuned versions, should work with Optimum-NVIDIA out of the box today. We are actively expanding support to include other text generation model architectures and tasks, all from within Hugging Face. We continue to push the boundaries of performance and plan to incorporate cutting-edge optimization techniques like In-Flight Batching to improve throughput when streaming prompts and INT4 quantization to run even bigger models on a single GPU.

What is the Top 1 Accuracy of swsl_resnet18 on ImageNet?,"[""In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on scaling up MobileNets and ResNet. To go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves state-of-the-art 84.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet. Our EfficientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7%), Flowers (98.8%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.\\*\nThis model was contributed by [adirik](https://huggingface.co/adirik).

The abstract from the paper is:\n\\*Diffusion models have significantly advanced the fields of image, audio, and video generation, but they depend on an iterative sampling process that causes slow generation. To overcome this limitation, we propose consistency models, a new family of models that generate high quality samples by directly mapping noise to data. They support fast one-step generation by design, while still allowing multistep sampling to trade compute for sample quality. They also support zero-shot data editing, such as image inpainting, colorization, and super-resolution, without requiring explicit training on these tasks. Consistency models can be trained either by distilling pre-trained diffusion models, or as standalone generative models altogether. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that they outperform existing distillation techniques for diffusion models in one- and few-step sampling, achieving the new state-of-the-art FID of 3.55 on CIFAR-10 and 6.20 on ImageNet 64x64 for one-step generation. When trained in isolation, consistency models become a new family of generative models that can outperform existing one-step, non-adversarial generative models on standard benchmarks such as CIFAR-10, ImageNet 64x64 and LSUN 256x256.\\*\nThe original codebase can be found at [openai/consistency\\_models](https://github.com/openai/consistency\\_models), and additional checkpoints are available at [openai](https://huggingface.co/openai)."", ""Let's have a look at them. ## Repository consistency\nThis regroups all the tests to make sure your PR leaves the repository in a good state, and is performed by the `ci/circleci: check\\_repository\\_consistency` check. You can locally run that check by executing the following:\n```bash\nmake repo-consistency\n```\nThis checks that:\n- All objects added to the init are documented (performed by `utils/check\\_repo.py`)\n- All `\\_\\_init\\_\\_.py` files have the same content in their two sections (performed by `utils/check\\_inits.py`)\n- All code identified as a copy from another module is consistent with the original (performed by `utils/check\\_copies.py`)\n- All configuration classes have at least one valid checkpoint mentioned in their docstrings (performed by `utils/check\\_config\\_docstrings.py`)\n- All configuration classes only contain attributes that are used in corresponding modeling files (performed by `utils/check\\_config\\_attributes.py`)\n- The translations of the READMEs and the index of the doc have the same model list as the main README (performed by `utils/check\\_copies.py`)\n- The auto-generated tables in the documentation are up to date (performed by `utils/check\\_table.py`)\n- The library has all objects available even if not all optional dependencies are installed (performed by `utils/check\\_dummies.py`)\n- All docstrings properly document the arguments in the signature of the object (performed by `utils/check\\_docstrings.py`)\nShould this check fail, the first two items require manual fixing, the last four can be fixed automatically for you by running the command\n```bash\nmake fix-copies\n```\nAdditional checks concern PRs that add new models, mainly that:\n- All models added are in an Auto-mapping (performed by `utils/check\\_repo.py`)\n- All models are properly tested (performed by `utils/check\\_repo.py`)\n### Check copies\nSince the Transformers library is very opinionated with respect to model code, and each model should fully be implemented in a single file without relying on other models, we have added a mechanism that checks whether a copy of the code of a layer of a given model stays consistent with the original.""]","Consistency Models were proposed by Yang Song, Prafulla Dhariwal, Mark Chen, and Ilya Sutskever.","Yang Song, Prafulla Dhariwal, Mark Chen, and Ilya Sutskever"

In this work, we produce a competitive convolution-free\ntransformer by training on Imagenet only. We train them on a single computer in less than 3 days.

However, we want to encourage you to ask for help whenever you think it's needed! We are happy about every question we get because it allows us to better understand your needs, possible misunderstandings, and most importantly a way for you to help us make this library better. That being said, this document's main purpose is to provide guidelines at how you can formulate your requests to increase your chances to be understood and to get support. There are two main venues to receive support: [the forums](https://discuss.huggingface.co/) and [the GitHub issues](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues). ## The Forums\n[The user forums](https://discuss.huggingface.co/) are supported by the wide community of the library users and backed up by developers when needed. If you have a difficulty with deploying this library or some questions, or you'd like to discuss a new feature, please first consider discussing those things at the forums.

Whether these are still buzzwords to you or you already have a solid grasp of it all, the authors will navigate you with humor, scientific rigor, and plenty of code examples into the deepest secrets of the coolest technology around. From “off-the-shelf pre-trained” to “from-scratch custom” models, and from performance to missing labels issues, the authors address practically every real-life struggle of an ML engineer and provide state-of-the-art solutions, making this book destined to dictate the standards in the field for years to come.\\_”\n—Luca Perrozi Ph.D., Data Science and Machine Learning Associate Manager at Accenture. Checkout [Natural Language Processing with Transformers](https://transformersbook.com/). ### Can you talk about the work you've done with the transformers library? \\*\\*Lewis:\\*\\* One of the things that I experienced in my previous jobs before Hugging Face was there's this challenge in the industry when deploying these models into production; these models are really large in terms of the number of parameters and this adds a lot of complexity to the requirements you might have. So for example, if you're trying to build a chatbot you need this model to be very fast and responsive. And most of the time these models are a bit too slow if you just take an off-the-shelf model, train it, and then try to integrate it into your application. So what I've been working on for the last few months on the transformers library is providing the functionality to export these models into a format that lets you run them much more efficiently using tools that we have at Hugging Face, but also just general tools in the open-source ecosystem. In a way, the philosophy of the transformers library is like writing lots of code so that the users don't have to write that code. In this particular example, what we're talking about is something called the ONNX format. It's a special format that is used in industry where you can basically have a model that's written in PyTorch but you can then convert it to TensorFlow or you can run it on some very dedicated hardware. And if you actually look at what's needed to make this conversion happen in the transformers library, it's fairly gnarly. But we make it so that you only really have to run one line of code and the library will take care of you. So the idea is that this particular feature lets machine learning engineers or even data scientists take their model, convert it to this format, and then optimize it to get faster latency and higher throughput.""]","The HuggingFace Transformers library is released under the Apache License, Version 2.0.","Apache License, Version 2.0"
What is the model structure of GPTSAN?,"[""This is just the usual DDP, except, instead of replicating the full model params, gradients and optimizer states, each GPU stores only a slice of it. And then at run-time when the full layer params are needed just for the given layer, all GPUs synchronize to give each other parts that they miss - this is it. This component is implemented by DeepSpeed. ## Tensor Parallelism\nIn Tensor Parallelism (TP) each GPU processes only a slice of a tensor and only aggregates the full tensor for operations that require the whole thing. In this section we use concepts and diagrams from the [Megatron-LM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM) paper: [Efficient Large-Scale Language Model Training on GPU Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04473). The main building block of any transformer is a fully connected `nn.Linear` followed by a nonlinear activation `GeLU`. Following the Megatron paper's notation, we can write the dot-product part of it as `Y = GeLU(XA)`, where `X` and `Y` are the input and output vectors, and `A` is the weight matrix. If we look at the computation in matrix form, it's easy to see how the matrix multiplication can be split between multiple GPUs:\n![Parallel GEMM](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/parallelism-tp-parallel\\_gemm.png)\nIf we split the weight matrix `A` column-wise across `N` GPUs and perform matrix multiplications `XA\\_1` through `XA\\_n` in parallel, then we will end up with `N` output vectors `Y\\_1, Y\\_2, ..., Y\\_n` which can be fed into `GeLU` independently:\n![independent GeLU](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/parallelism-tp-independent-gelu.png). Notice with the Y matrix split along the columns, we can split the second GEMM along its rows so that it takes the output of the GeLU directly without any extra communication. Using this principle, we can update an MLP of arbitrary depth, while synchronizing the GPUs after each row-column sequence. The Megatron-LM paper authors provide a helpful illustration for that:\n![parallel shard processing](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/parallelism-tp-parallel\\_shard\\_processing.png)\nHere `f` is an identity operator in the forward pass and all reduce in the backward pass while `g` is an all reduce in the forward pass and identity in the backward pass. Parallelizing the multi-headed attention layers is even simpler, since they are already inherently parallel, due to having multiple independent heads! ![parallel self-attention](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/parallelism-tp-parallel\\_self\\_attention.png)\nSpecial considerations: Due to the two all reduces per layer in both the forward and backward passes, TP requires a very fast interconnect between devices."", ""This vector is treated as the first embedding in self-attention to bring extraneous attention to the generated tokens. In the pre-trained model published from `Tanrei/GPTSAN-japanese`, the Spout Vector is a 128-dimensional vector that passes through 8 fully connected layers in the model and is projected into the space acting as external attention. The Spout Vector projected by the fully connected layer is split to be passed to all self-attentions. ## GPTSanJapaneseConfig\n[[autodoc]] GPTSanJapaneseConfig\n## GPTSanJapaneseTokenizer\n[[autodoc]] GPTSanJapaneseTokenizer\n## GPTSanJapaneseModel\n[[autodoc]] GPTSanJapaneseModel\n## GPTSanJapaneseForConditionalGeneration\n[[autodoc]] GPTSanJapaneseForConditionalGeneration\n- forward"", ""!--Copyright 2023 The HuggingFace Team.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on scaling up MobileNets and ResNet. To go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves state-of-the-art 84.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet. Our EfficientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7%), Flowers (98.8%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.\\*\nThis model was contributed by [adirik](https://huggingface.co/adirik).

What utility allows starting multi-gpu training in a Jupyter Notebook?,"[""Finally, if we want our training to take a couple of minutes instead of a few hours, we will need to use a GPU. The first step is to get one, for instance by using a colab notebook. Then you need to actually send your model and training data on it by using a torch device. Double-check the following lines print a CUDA device for you! We can now put everything together! First we put our model in training mode (which will activate the training behavior for some layers like Dropout) then go through the number of epochs we picked and all the data in our training dataloader. Then we go through all the steps we have seen already: send the data to the GPU, compute the model outputs, and in particular the loss. Use the loss to compute gradients, then make a training step with the optimizer. Update the learning rate in our scheduler for the next iteration and zero the gradients of the optimizer. Once this is finished, we can evaluate our model very easily with a metric from the Datasets library. First we put our model in evaluation mode, then go through all the data in the evaluation data loader. As we have seen in the Trainer video, the model outputs logits and we need to apply the argmax function to convert them into predictions. The metric object then has an add\\_batch method we can use to send it those intermediate predictions."", ""Launching a training inside a notebook will then display a progress bar and complete the table you see here as you pass every epoch."", ""Next let's have a look at one of the most important aspects when having multiple GPUs: connectivity. ### Multi-GPU Connectivity\nIf you use multiple GPUs the way cards are inter-connected can have a huge impact on the total training time.

Introduction:\nNatural language generation (i.e. text generation) is one of the core tasks in natural language processing (NLP). In this blog, we introduce the current state-of-the-art decoding method, \\_\\_\\_Contrastive Search\\_\\_\\_, for neural text generation. Contrastive search is originally proposed in \\_\""A Contrastive Framework for Neural Text Generation\""\\_ [[1]](#references) ([[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06417)[[Official Implementation]](https://github.com/yxuansu/SimCTG)) at NeurIPS 2022. Moreover, in this follow-up work, \\_\""Contrastive Search Is What You Need For Neural Text Generation\""\\_ [[2]](#references) ([[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14140) [[Official Implementation]](https://github.com/yxuansu/Contrastive\\_Search\\_Is\\_What\\_You\\_Need)), the authors further demonstrate that contrastive search can generate human-level text using \\*\\*off-the-shelf\\*\\* language models across \\*\\*16\\*\\* languages."", ""set the probability of undesirable words or sequences to 0). The following step in text generation is to select the next token from these logits. Common strategies include picking the most likely token, known as greedy decoding, or sampling from their distribution, also called multinomial sampling. Chaining model forward passes with next token selection iteratively gets you text generation. This explanation is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to decoding methods; please refer to [our blog post on text generation](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate) for an in-depth exploration. [](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/assisted-generation/gif_2_1080p.mov)\nFrom the description above, the latency bottleneck in text generation is clear: running a model forward pass for large models is slow, and you may need to do hundreds of them in a sequence. But let’s dive deeper: why are forward passes slow? Forward passes are typically dominated by matrix multiplications and, after a quick visit to the [corresponding wikipedia section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix\\_multiplication\\_algorithm#Communication-avoiding\\_and\\_distributed\\_algorithms), you can tell that memory bandwidth is the limitation in this operation (e.g. from the GPU RAM to the GPU compute cores). In other words, \\*the bottleneck in the forward pass comes from loading the model layer weights into the computation cores of your device, not from performing the computations themselves\\*. At the moment, you have three main avenues you can explore to get the most out of text generation, all tackling the performance of the model forward pass. First, you have the hardware-specific model optimizations. For instance, your device may be compatible with [Flash Attention](https://github.com/HazyResearch/flash-attention), which speeds up the attention layer through a reorder of the operations, or [INT8 quantization](https://huggingface.co/blog/hf-bitsandbytes-integration), which reduces the size of the model weights. Second, when you know you’ll get concurrent text generation requests, you can batch the inputs and massively increase the throughput with a small latency penalty. The model layer weights loaded into the device are now used on several input rows in parallel, which means that you’ll get more tokens out for approximately the same memory bandwidth burden. The catch with batching is that you need additional device memory (or to offload the memory somewhere) – at the end of this spectrum, you can see projects like [FlexGen](https://github.com/FMInference/FlexGen) which optimize throughput at the expense of latency. ```python\n# Example showcasing the impact of batched generation. Measurement device: RTX3090\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\nimport time\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from\\_pretrained(\""distilgpt2\"")\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from\\_pretrained(\""distilgpt2\"").to(\""cuda\"")\ninputs = tokenizer([\""Hello world\""], return\\_tensors=\""pt\"").to(\""cuda\"")\ndef print\\_tokens\\_per\\_second(batch\\_size):\nnew\\_tokens = 100\ncumulative\\_time = 0\n# warmup\nmodel.generate(\n\\*\\*inputs, do\\_sample=True, max\\_new\\_tokens=new\\_tokens, num\\_return\\_sequences=batch\\_size\n)\nfor \\_ in range(10):\nstart = time.time()\nmodel.generate(\n\\*\\*inputs, do\\_sample=True, max\\_new\\_tokens=new\\_tokens, num\\_return\\_sequences=batch\\_size\n)\ncumulative\\_time += time.time() - start\nprint(f\""Tokens per second: {new\\_tokens \\* batch\\_size \\* 10 / cumulative\\_time:.1f}\"")\nprint\\_tokens\\_per\\_second(1) # Tokens per second: 418.3\nprint\\_tokens\\_per\\_second(64) # Tokens per second: 16266.2 (~39x more tokens per second)\n```\nFinally, if you have multiple devices available to you, you can distribute the workload using [Tensor Parallelism](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/perf\\_train\\_gpu\\_many#tensor-parallelism) and obtain lower latency."", ""For long generations, we're talking about several orders of magnitude. Walking a step towards reality, let's assume the assistant model has lost its oracle properties. Now it’s a latency-free model that gets some of the candidate tokens wrong, according to your model. Due to the autoregressive nature of the task, as soon as the assistant gets a token wrong, all subsequent candidates must be invalidated. However, that does not prevent you from querying the assistant again, after correcting the wrong token with your model, and repeating this process iteratively. Even if the assistant fails a few tokens, text generation would have an order of magnitude less latency than in its original form. Obviously, there are no latency-free assistant models. Nevertheless, it is relatively easy to find a model that approximates some other model’s text generation outputs – smaller versions of the same architecture trained similarly often fit this property. Moreover, when the difference in model sizes becomes significant, the cost of using the smaller model as an assistant becomes an afterthought after factoring in the benefits of skipping a few forward passes! You now understand the core of \\_assisted generation\\_. ## Greedy decoding with assisted generation\nAssisted generation is a balancing act. You want the assistant to quickly generate a candidate sequence while being as accurate as possible. If the assistant has poor quality, your get the cost of using the assistant model with little to no benefits. On the other hand, optimizing the quality of the candidate sequences may imply the use of slow assistants, resulting in a net slowdown. While we can't automate the selection of the assistant model for you, we’ve included an additional requirement and a heuristic to ensure the time spent with the assistant stays in check.""]","The authors of ""Contrastive Search Is What You Need For Neural Text Generation"" are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Where can you find BERT's conversion script for porting from TensorFlow to PyTorch?,"[""### 4. Model implementation\nNow it's time to finally start coding.

To save and store your model weights in the more secure `safetensor` format, we recommend converting your weights to `.safetensors`. The easiest way to convert your model weights is to use the [Convert Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/diffusers/convert), given your model weights are already stored on the Hub. The Convert Space downloads the pickled weights, converts them, and opens a Pull Request to upload the newly converted `.safetensors` file to your repository. For larger models, the Space may be a bit slower because its resources are tied up in converting other models. You can also try running the [convert.py](https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors/blob/main/bindings/python/convert.py) script (this is what the Space is running) locally to convert your weights. Feel free to ping [@Narsil](https://huggingface.co/Narsil) for any issues with the Space."", ""You can train a model in PyTorch and then export it to TorchScript to free the model from Python performance constraints. PyTorch [traces](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.jit.trace.html) a model to return a [`ScriptFunction`] that is optimized with just-in-time compilation (JIT). Compared to the default eager mode, JIT mode in PyTorch typically yields better performance for inference using optimization techniques like operator fusion. For a gentle introduction to TorchScript, see the [Introduction to PyTorch TorchScript](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/Intro\\_to\\_TorchScript\\_tutorial.html) tutorial. With the [`Trainer`] class, you can enable JIT mode for CPU inference by setting the `--jit\\_mode\\_eval` flag:\n```bash\npython run\\_qa.py \\\n--model\\_name\\_or\\_path csarron/bert-base-uncased-squad-v1 \\\n--dataset\\_name squad \\\n--do\\_eval \\\n--max\\_seq\\_length 384 \\\n--doc\\_stride 128 \\\n--output\\_dir /tmp/ \\\n--no\\_cuda \\\n--jit\\_mode\\_eval\n```\nFor PyTorch >= 1.14.0, JIT-mode could benefit any model for prediction and evaluaion since the dict input is supported in `jit.trace`. For PyTorch < 1.14.0, JIT-mode could benefit a model if its forward parameter order matches the tuple input order in `jit.trace`, such as a question-answering model. If the forward parameter order does not match the tuple input order in `jit.trace`, like a text classification model, `jit.trace` will fail and we are capturing this with the exception here to make it fallback.

What are the advantages of streaming mode over downloading a dataset?,"[""3. \\*\\*Easy experimentation:\\*\\* you can experiment on a handful samples to check that your script works without having to download the entire dataset. There is one caveat to streaming mode. When downloading a dataset, both the raw data and processed data are saved locally\nto disk. If we want to re-use this dataset, we can directly load the processed data from disk, skipping the download and\nprocessing steps. Consequently, we only have to perform the downloading and processing operations once, after which we\ncan re-use the prepared data. With streaming mode, the data is not downloaded to disk. Thus, neither the downloaded nor\npre-processed data are cached. If we want to re-use the dataset, the streaming steps must be repeated, with the audio\nfiles loaded and processed on the fly again. For this reason, it is advised to download datasets that you are likely to use\nmultiple times. How can you enable streaming mode? Easy! Just set `streaming=True` when you load your dataset. The rest will be taken\ncare for you:\n```python\ngigaspeech = load\\_dataset(\""speechcolab/gigaspeech\"", \""xs\"", streaming=True)\n```\nAll the steps covered so far in this tutorial can be applied to the streaming dataset without any code changes."", ""atasets and DataFrames equals love. Although the processing functions of Datasets will cover most the cases needed to train a model, there are times when you’ll need to switch to a library like Pandas to access more powerful features or high-level APIs for visualisation. Fortunately, Datasets is designed to be interoperable with libraries like Pandas, as well as NumPy, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX. In this video, we'll take a look at how we can quickly switch our data to Pandas DataFrames and back. As an example, let's suppose we're analysing Supreme Court cases from Switzerland. As usual we download our dataset from the Hub using the load\\_dataset() function, and you can see that the first element of the training set is an ordinary Python dictionary with various fields of interest. Now suppose that before we train any models, we'd like to explore the data a bit.

It leverages the pre-trained contextual embeddings from [BERT](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased) models and matches words in candidate and reference sentences by cosine similarity. Moreover, BERTScore computes precision, recall, and F1 measure, which can be useful for evaluating different language generation tasks. ## How to use\nBERTScore takes 3 mandatory arguments : `predictions` (a list of string of candidate sentences), `references` (a list of strings or list of list of strings of reference sentences) and either `lang` (a string of two letters indicating the language of the sentences, in [ISO 639-1 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_ISO\\_639-1\\_codes)) or `model\\_type` (a string specififying which model to use, according to the BERT specification). The default behavior of the metric is to use the suggested model for the target language when one is specified, otherwise to use the `model\\_type` indicated. ```python\nfrom datasets import load\\_metric\nbertscore = load\\_metric(\""bertscore\"")\npredictions = [\""hello there\"", \""general kenobi\""]\nreferences = [\""hello there\"", \""general kenobi\""]\nresults = bertscore.compute(predictions=predictions, references=references, lang=\""en\"")\n```\nBERTScore also accepts multiple optional arguments:\n`num\\_layers` (int): The layer of representation to use."", ""the contradiction score. This is sometimes called \""multi-class multi-label\"" classification. - `--temperature` (default: `1.0`): The temperature applied to the softmax of the teacher model predictions. A\nhigher temperature results in a student with smoother (lower confidence) predictions than the teacher while a value\n`<1` resultings in a higher-confidence, peaked distribution. The default `1.0` is equivalent to no smoothing. - `--teacher\\_batch\\_size` (default: `32`): The batch size used for generating a single set of teacher predictions. Does not affect training. Use `--per\\_device\\_train\\_batch\\_size` to change the training batch size. Any of the arguments in the 🤗 Trainer's\n[`TrainingArguments`](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main\\_classes/trainer.html?#trainingarguments) can also be\nmodified, such as `--learning\\_rate`, `--fp16`, `--no\\_cuda`, `--warmup\\_steps`, etc. Run `python distill\\_classifier.py\n-h` for a full list of available arguments or consult the [Trainer\ndocumentation](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main\\_classes/trainer.html#trainingarguments).""]",The teacher model used with `frugalscore_tiny_bert-base_mover-score` is BERT-Base.,BERT-Base
What class is used to compile the model to run on IPUs?,"[""Here, we show the transformed images. Our dataset is now ready to be used. ## Preparing the model\n\nTo train a model on the IPU we need to import it from Hugging Face Hub and define a trainer using the IPUTrainer class. The IPUTrainer class takes the same arguments as the original [Transformer Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/trainer) and works in tandem with the IPUConfig object which specifies the behaviour for compilation and execution on the IPU. Now we import the ViT model from Hugging Face. To use this model on the IPU we need to load the IPU configuration, `IPUConfig`, which gives control to all the parameters specific to Graphcore IPUs (existing IPU configs [can be found here](https://huggingface.co/Graphcore)). We are going to use `Graphcore/vit-base-ipu`. Let's set our training hyperparameters using `IPUTrainingArguments`. This subclasses the Hugging Face `TrainingArguments` class, adding parameters specific to the IPU and its execution characteristics. ## Implementing a custom performance metric for evaluation\n\nThe performance of multi-label classification models can be assessed using the area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve (AUC\\_ROC)."", ""The Stable Diffusion model is distributed under the CreateML OpenRail-M license. It's an open license that claims no rights on the outputs you generate and prohibits you from deliberately producing illegal or harmful content. The [model card](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4) provides more details, so take a moment to read them and consider carefully whether you accept the license. If you do, you need to be a registered user in the Hub and use an access token for the code to work. You have two options to provide your access token:\n- Use the `huggingface-cli login` command-line tool in your terminal and paste your token when prompted. It will be saved in a file in your computer. - Or use `notebook\\_login()` in a notebook, which does the same thing. The following cell will present a login interface unless you've already authenticated before in this computer. You'll need to paste your access token. ``` python\nif not (Path.home()/'.huggingface'/'token').exists(): notebook\\_login()\n```\nTPU devices support `bfloat16`, an efficient half-float type. We'll use it for our tests, but you can also use `float32` to use full precision instead. ``` python\ndtype = jnp.bfloat16\n```\nFlax is a functional framework, so models are stateless and parameters are stored outside them. Loading the pre-trained Flax pipeline will return both the pipeline itself and the model weights (or parameters). We are using a `bf16` version of the weights, which leads to type warnings that you can safely ignore. ``` python\npipeline, params = FlaxStableDiffusionPipeline.from\\_pretrained(\n\""CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4\"",\nrevision=\""bf16\"",\ndtype=dtype,\n)\n```\n## Inference\nSince TPUs usually have 8 devices working in parallel, we'll replicate our prompt as many times as devices we have."", ""\""distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english\"",\n... export=True,\n... provider=\""ROCMExecutionProvider\"",\n... )\n```\nThe model can then be used with the common 🤗 Transformers API for inference and evaluation, such as [pipelines](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/onnxruntime/usage\\_guides/pipelines).

What is the name of the ResNet variant that uses squeeze-and-excitation blocks?,"[""This is generally known as \""ResNet v1.5\"". ResNet introduced residual connections, they allow to train networks with an unseen number of layers (up to 1000). ResNet won the 2015 ILSVRC & COCO competition, one important milestone in deep computer vision. The abstract from the paper is the following:\n\\*Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset.

In this case, it is a simple function that adds \""Hello\"" before your name, but it can be \\*any\\* Python function in general. For example, in machine learning applications, this function would \\*call a model to make a prediction\\* on an input and return the output. - Then, we create a Gradio `Interface` with three arguments, `fn`, `inputs`, and `outputs`. These arguments define the prediction function, as well as the \\_type\\_ of input and output components we would like. In our case, both components are simple text boxes. - We then call the `launch()` method on the `Interface` that we created. If you run this code, the interface below will appear automatically within a Jupyter/Colab notebook, or pop in a browser on \\*\\*[http://localhost:7860](http://localhost:7860/)\\*\\* if running from a script.

What does ZeRO-powered data parallelism store on each GPU?,"[""Varuna further attempts to improve the\nschedule by using simulations to discover the most efficient scheduling. OSLO has pipeline parallelism implementation based on the Transformers without `nn.Sequential` conversion. ## Tensor Parallelism\nIn Tensor Parallelism, each GPU processes a slice of a tensor and only aggregates the full tensor for operations requiring it. To describe this method, this section of the guide relies on the concepts and diagrams from the [Megatron-LM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM)\npaper: [Efficient Large-Scale Language Model Training on GPU Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04473). The main building block of any transformer is a fully connected `nn.Linear` followed by a nonlinear activation `GeLU`. The dot dot-product part of it, following the Megatron's paper notation, can be written as `Y = GeLU(XA)`, where `X` is\nan input vector, `Y` is the output vector, and `A` is the weight matrix. If we look at the computation in matrix form, you can see how the matrix multiplication can be split between multiple GPUs:\n\n![Parallel GEMM](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/parallelism-tp-parallel_gemm.png)\n\nIf we split the weight matrix `A` column-wise across `N` GPUs and perform matrix multiplications `XA\\_1` through `XA\\_n` in parallel,\nthen we will end up with `N` output vectors `Y\\_1, Y\\_2, ..., Y\\_n` which can be fed into `GeLU` independently:\n\n![Independent GeLU](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/parallelism-tp-independent-gelu.png)\n\nUsing this principle, we can update a multi-layer perceptron of arbitrary depth, without the need for any synchronization\nbetween GPUs until the very end, where we need to reconstruct the output vector from shards. The Megatron-LM paper authors\nprovide a helpful illustration for that:\n\n![Parallel shard processing](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/parallelism-tp-parallel_shard_processing.png)\n\nParallelizing the multi-headed attention layers is even simpler, since they are already inherently parallel, due to having\nmultiple independent heads! ![Parallel self-attention](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/parallelism-tp-parallel_self_attention.png)\n\nSpecial considerations: TP requires very fast network, and therefore it's not advisable to do TP across more than one node. Practically, if a node has 4 GPUs, the highest TP degree is therefore 4. If you need a TP degree of 8, you need to use\nnodes that have at least 8 GPUs."", ""Why would you want to use DeepSpeed with just one GPU? 1. It has a ZeRO-offload feature which can delegate some computations and memory to the host's CPU and RAM, and thus\nleave more GPU resources for model's needs - e.g. larger batch size, or enabling a fitting of a very big model which\nnormally won't fit. 2. It provides a smart GPU memory management system, that minimizes memory fragmentation, which again allows you to fit\nbigger models and data batches. While we are going to discuss the configuration in details next, the key to getting a huge improvement on a single GPU\nwith DeepSpeed is to have at least the following configuration in the configuration file:\n```json\n{\n\""zero\\_optimization\"": {\n\""stage\"": 2,\n\""offload\\_optimizer\"": {\n\""device\"": \""cpu\"",\n\""pin\\_memory\"": true\n},\n\""allgather\\_partitions\"": true,\n\""allgather\\_bucket\\_size\"": 2e8,\n\""reduce\\_scatter\"": true,\n\""reduce\\_bucket\\_size\"": 2e8,\n\""overlap\\_comm\"": true,\n\""contiguous\\_gradients\"": true\n}\n}\n```\nwhich enables optimizer offload and some other important features."", ""Additionally DeepSpeed is currently developing a related product called Deepspeed-Inference which has no relationship\nto the ZeRO technology, but instead uses tensor parallelism to scale models that can't fit onto a single GPU. This is a\nwork in progress and we will provide the integration once that product is complete. ### Memory Requirements\nSince Deepspeed ZeRO can offload memory to CPU (and NVMe) the framework provides utils that allow one to tell how much CPU and GPU memory will be needed depending on the number of GPUs being used. Let's estimate how much memory is needed to finetune \""bigscience/T0\\_3B\"" on a single GPU:\n```bash\n$ python -c 'from transformers import AutoModel; \\\nfrom deepspeed.runtime.zero.stage3 import estimate\\_zero3\\_model\\_states\\_mem\\_needs\\_all\\_live; \\\nmodel = AutoModel.from\\_pretrained(\""bigscience/T0\\_3B\""); \\\nestimate\\_zero3\\_model\\_states\\_mem\\_needs\\_all\\_live(model, num\\_gpus\\_per\\_node=1, num\\_nodes=1)'\n[...]\nEstimated memory needed for params, optim states and gradients for a:\nHW: Setup with 1 node, 1 GPU per node.""]","ZeRO-powered data parallelism stores the following on each GPU:

1. **Model Parameters**: Each GPU holds a shard of the model parameters.
2. **Optimizer States**: Each GPU maintains a shard of the optimizer states.
3. **Gradients**: Each GPU keeps a shard of the gradients.

You can learn more about this in the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07779). ## Exploring adapter-transformers in the Hub\nYou can find over a hundred `adapter-transformer` models by filtering at the left of the [models page](https://huggingface.co/models?library=adapter-transformers&sort=downloads). Some adapter models can be found in the Adapter Hub [repository](https://github.com/adapter-hub/hub). Models from both sources are then aggregated in the [AdapterHub](https://adapterhub.ml/explore/). ## Using existing models\nFor a full guide on loading pre-trained adapters, we recommend checking out the [official guide](https://docs.adapterhub.ml/loading.html). As a brief summary, once you load a model with the usual `\\*Model` classes from 🤗`transformers`, you can use the `load\\_adapter` method to load and activate the Adapter (remember `adapter-transformers` extends 🤗`transformers`.). ```py\nfrom transformers import AutoModelWithHeads\nmodel = AutoModelWithHeads.from\\_pretrained(\""bert-base-uncased\"")\nadapter\\_name = model.load\\_adapter(\""AdapterHub/bert-base-uncased-pf-imdb\"", source=\""hf\"")\nmodel.active\\_adapters = adapter\\_name\n```\nYou can also use `list\\_adapters` to find all Adapter Models programmatically\n```py\nfrom transformers import list\\_adapters\n# source can be \""ah\"" (AdapterHub), \""hf\"" (hf.co) or None (for both, default)\nadapter\\_infos = list\\_adapters(source=\""hf\"", model\\_name=\""bert-base-uncased\"")\n```\nIf you want to see how to load a specific model, you can click `Use in Adapter Transformers` and you will be given a working snippet that you can load it! ![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/libraries-adapter_transformers_snippet1.png)\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/libraries-adapter_transformers-snippet1-dark.png)\n\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/libraries-adapter_transformers_snippet2.png)\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/libraries-adapter_transformers-snippet2-dark.png)\n\n## Sharing your models\nFor a full guide on sharing models with `adapter-transformers`, we recommend checking out the [official guide](https://docs.adapterhub.ml/huggingface\\_hub.html#uploading-to-the-hub). You can share your Adapter by using the `push\\_adapter\\_to\\_hub` method from a model that already contains an adapter. ```py\nmodel.push\\_adapter\\_to\\_hub(\n\""my-awesome-adapter\"",\n\""awesome\\_adapter\"",\nadapterhub\\_tag=\""sentiment/imdb\"",\ndatasets\\_tag=\""imdb\""\n)\n```\nThis command creates a repository with an automatically generated model card and all necessary metadata."", ""--\ntitle: \""Efficient Controllable Generation for SDXL with T2I-Adapters\""\nthumbnail: /blog/assets/t2i-sdxl-adapters/thumbnail.png\nauthors:\n- user: Adapter\nguest: true\n- user: valhalla\n- user: sayakpaul\n- user: Xintao\nguest: true\n- user: hysts\n---\n# Efficient Controllable Generation for SDXL with T2I-Adapters\n\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/t2i-adapters-sdxl/hf_tencent.png)\n\n[T2I-Adapter](https://huggingface.co/papers/2302.08453) is an efficient plug-and-play model that provides extra guidance to pre-trained text-to-image models while freezing the original large text-to-image models. T2I-Adapter aligns internal knowledge in T2I models with external control signals. We can train various adapters according to different conditions and achieve rich control and editing effects. As a contemporaneous work, [ControlNet](https://hf.co/papers/2302.05543) has a similar function and is widely used. However, it can be \\*\\*computationally expensive\\*\\* to run. This is because, during each denoising step of the reverse diffusion process, both the ControlNet and UNet need to be run. In addition, ControlNet emphasizes the importance of copying the UNet encoder as a control model, resulting in a larger parameter number. Thus, the generation is bottlenecked by the size of the ControlNet (the larger, the slower the process becomes). T2I-Adapters provide a competitive advantage to ControlNets in this matter. T2I-Adapters are smaller in size, and unlike ControlNets, T2I-Adapters are run just once for the entire course of the denoising process. | \\*\\*Model Type\\*\\* | \\*\\*Model Parameters\\*\\* | \\*\\*Storage (fp16)\\*\\* |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [ControlNet-SDXL](https://huggingface.co/diffusers/controlnet-canny-sdxl-1.0) | 1251 M | 2.5 GB |\n| [ControlLoRA](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/control-lora) (with rank 128) | 197.78 M (84.19% reduction) | 396 MB (84.53% reduction) |\n| [T2I-Adapter-SDXL](https://huggingface.co/TencentARC/t2i-adapter-canny-sdxl-1.0) | 79 M (\\*\\*\\_93.69% reduction\\_\\*\\*) | 158 MB (\\*\\*\\_94% reduction\\_\\*\\*) |\nOver the past few weeks, the Diffusers team and the T2I-Adapter authors have been collaborating to bring the support of T2I-Adapters for [Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)](https://huggingface.co/papers/2307.01952) in [`diffusers`](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers).

What is one advantage of using a generator of lists of texts in `train_new_from_iterator()`?,"[""Training from memory\nIn the [Quicktour](quicktour), we saw how to build and train a\ntokenizer using text files, but we can actually use any Python Iterator. In this section we'll see a few different ways of training our\ntokenizer. For all the examples listed below, we'll use the same [`~tokenizers.Tokenizer`] and\n[`~tokenizers.trainers.Trainer`], built as\nfollowing:\n{\""path\"": \""../../bindings/python/tests/documentation/test\\_tutorial\\_train\\_from\\_iterators.py\"",\n\""language\"": \""python\"",\n\""start-after\"": \""START init\\_tokenizer\\_trainer\"",\n\""end-before\"": \""END init\\_tokenizer\\_trainer\"",\n\""dedent\"": 8}\nThis tokenizer is based on the [`~tokenizers.models.Unigram`] model.

For more information on the components used here, you can check\n[here](components). ## The most basic way\nAs you probably guessed already, the easiest way to train our tokenizer\nis by using a `List`{.interpreted-text role=\""obj\""}:\n{\""path\"": \""../../bindings/python/tests/documentation/test\\_tutorial\\_train\\_from\\_iterators.py\"",\n\""language\"": \""python\"",\n\""start-after\"": \""START train\\_basic\"",\n\""end-before\"": \""END train\\_basic\"",\n\""dedent\"": 8}\nEasy, right?"", ""Here is how it can be done with code, with one loop to concatenate all the texts and another one to chunk it. Notice how it reduces the number of samples in our dataset here, there must have been quite a few short entries! Once this is done, the masking is the easy part. There is a data collator designed specifically for this in the Transformers library. You can use it directly in the Trainer, or when converting your datasets to tensorflow datasets before doing Keras.fit, with the to\\_tf\\_dataset method."", ""You can use anything working as an iterator here, be it a\n`List`{.interpreted-text role=\""obj\""}, `Tuple`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\""obj\""}, or a `np.Array`{.interpreted-text role=\""obj\""}.

What does the stride argument control in the tokenizer?,"[""he tokenization pipeline involves several steps that convert raw text into numbers. In this video, we will see what happens during the pre-tokenization step. The pre-tokenization operation is the operation performed after the normalization of the text and before the application of the tokenization algorithm. This step consists in applying rules that do not need to be learned to perform a first division of the text. Let's look at how several tokenizers pre\\_tokenize this example. The gpt 2 pretokenization divides the text on spaces and some punctuation - but the apostrophe is not a division criterion for example. We also notice that spaces have been replaced by a capital G with a dot above. Albert's pre-tokenization divides the text at the level of spaces, adds a space at the beginning of the sentence and replaces spaces with a special underscore. Finally, Bert's pre-tokenization divides the text at the level of punctuation and spaces. Unlike the previous tokenizers, spaces are not transformed and integrated to the tokens produced with this pre-tokenizer. Through these 3 examples, we could observe the two main types of operations brought by the pre-tokenization: some changes on the text and the division of the string into tokens that can be associated to words. Finally, the \""backend\\_tokenizer\"" of the fast tokenizers also allows to test the pre-tokenization operation very easily thanks to its \""pre\\_tokenize\\_str\"" method. We notice that the output of this operation is composed of both tokens and offsets which allow to link the token to its position in the text given in input of the method."", ""et's take a look at subword-based tokenization. Understanding why subword-based tokenization is interesting requires understanding the flaws of word-based and character-based tokenization. If you haven't seen the first videos on word-based and character-based tokenization, we recommend you check them out before looking at this video. Subword-tokenization lies in between character-based and word-based tokenization algorithms. The idea is to find a middle ground between very large vocabularies, large quantity of out-of-vocabulary tokens, loss of meaning across very similar words, for word-based tokenizers, and very long sequences, less meaningful individual tokens for character-based tokenizers. These algorithms rely on the following principle: frequently used words should not be split into smaller subwords, but rare words should be decomposed into meaningful subwords. An example is the word dog: we would like to have our tokenizer to have a single ID for the word dog, rather than splitting it into characters: d, o, and g. However, when encountering the word dogs, we would like our tokenizer to understand that at the root, this is still the word dog, with an added s while slightly changes the meaning while keeping the original idea. Another example is a complex word like tokenization, which can be split into meaningful subwords. The root of the word is token, and ization completes the root to give it a slightly different meaning. It makes sense to split the word into two: token, as the root of the word (labeled as the \""start\"" of the word). ization as additional information (labeled as a \""completion\"" of the word)."", ""n this video we will see together what is the purpose of training a tokenizer, what are the key steps to follow and what is the easiest way to do it. You will ask yourself the question \""Should I train a new tokenizer?\"" when you plan to train a new model from scratch. A trained tokenizer would not be suitable for your corpus if your corpus is in a different language, uses new characters such as accents or upper cased letters, has a specific vocabulary, for example medical or legal, or uses a different style, a language from another century for instance. For example, if I take the tokenizer trained for the bert-base-uncased model and ignore its normalization step then we can see that the tokenization operation on the English sentence \""here is a sentence adapted to our tokenizer\"" produces a rather satisfactory list of tokens in the sense that this sentence of 8 words is tokenized into 9 tokens. On the other hand if we use this same tokenizer on a sentence in Bengali, we see that either a word is divided into many sub tokens or that the tokenizer does not know one of the unicode characters and returns only an unknown token. The fact that a \""common\"" word is split into many tokens can be problematic because language models can only handle a sequence of tokens of limited length. A tokenizer that excessively splits your initial text may even impact the performance of your model. Unknown tokens are also problematic because the model will not be able to extract any information from the \""unknown\"" part of the text. In this other example, we can see that the tokenizer replaces words containing characters with accents and capital letters with unknown tokens. Finally, if we use again this tokenizer to tokenize medical vocabulary we see again that a single word is divided into many sub tokens: 4 for \""paracetamol\"" and \""pharyngitis\"".""]","The stride argument in the tokenizer controls the overlap between the input sequences when tokenizing long texts. It allows you to specify how much of the previous sequence should be included in the next tokenization step. This is particularly useful when dealing with long texts that exceed the maximum token limit, as it helps to ensure that important context is not lost between segments. By adjusting the stride, you can manage the trade-off between context preservation and the number of tokens generated.",The stride argument controls the number of overlapping tokens.

What method is called to compute gradients in the training pipeline?,"[""Finally, if we want our training to take a couple of minutes instead of a few hours, we will need to use a GPU. The first step is to get one, for instance by using a colab notebook. Then you need to actually send your model and training data on it by using a torch device. Double-check the following lines print a CUDA device for you! We can now put everything together! First we put our model in training mode (which will activate the training behavior for some layers like Dropout) then go through the number of epochs we picked and all the data in our training dataloader. Then we go through all the steps we have seen already: send the data to the GPU, compute the model outputs, and in particular the loss. Use the loss to compute gradients, then make a training step with the optimizer. Update the learning rate in our scheduler for the next iteration and zero the gradients of the optimizer. Once this is finished, we can evaluate our model very easily with a metric from the Datasets library. First we put our model in evaluation mode, then go through all the data in the evaluation data loader. As we have seen in the Trainer video, the model outputs logits and we need to apply the argmax function to convert them into predictions. The metric object then has an add\\_batch method we can use to send it those intermediate predictions."", ""Along with complete equivalence to regular distributed training and easy scalability, this method also has the benefit of built-in fault tolerance, which we illustrate below. Let's consider a couple of potential failure cases that we might encounter throughout a collaborative experiment. By far, the most frequent scenario is that one or several peers disconnect from the training procedure: they might have an unstable connection or simply want to use their GPUs for something else. In this case, we only suffer a minor setback of training: the contribution of these peers gets deducted from the currently accumulated batch size, but other participants will compensate for that with their gradients. Also, if more peers join, the target batch size will simply be reached faster, and our training procedure will naturally speed up. You can see a demonstration of this in the video:### Adaptive averaging\nNow that we have discussed the overall training procedure, there remains one more question: how do we actually aggregate the gradients of participants?"", ""For instance, for fp16 data type a multiple of 8 is recommended, unless\nit's an A100 GPU, in which case use multiples of 64. For parameters that are small, consider also [Dimension Quantization Effects](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/dl-performance-matrix-multiplication/index.html#dim-quantization). This is where tiling happens and the right multiplier can have a significant speedup. ## Gradient Accumulation\nThe \\*\\*gradient accumulation\\*\\* method aims to calculate gradients in smaller increments instead of computing them for the\nentire batch at once. This approach involves iteratively calculating gradients in smaller batches by performing forward\nand backward passes through the model and accumulating the gradients during the process. Once a sufficient number of\ngradients have been accumulated, the model's optimization step is executed. By employing gradient accumulation, it\nbecomes possible to increase the \\*\\*effective batch size\\*\\* beyond the limitations imposed by the GPU's memory capacity. However, it is important to note that the additional forward and backward passes introduced by gradient accumulation can\nslow down the training process. You can enable gradient accumulation by adding the `gradient\\_accumulation\\_steps` argument to [`TrainingArguments`]:\n```py\ntraining\\_args = TrainingArguments(per\\_device\\_train\\_batch\\_size=1, gradient\\_accumulation\\_steps=4, \\*\\*default\\_args)\n```\nIn the above example, your effective batch size becomes 4.""]","In the training pipeline, gradients are computed using the backward pass through the model. After calculating the loss, you use the loss to compute gradients, which is typically done by calling the `backward()` method on the loss tensor. This process allows the model to update its parameters based on the computed gradients during the optimization step.",backward()
Who created the Falcon language models?,"[""They are made available under the Apache 2.0 license. Falcon's architecture is modern and optimized for inference, with multi-query attention and support for efficient\nattention variants like `FlashAttention`. Both 'base' models trained only as causal language models as well as\n'instruct' models that have received further fine-tuning are available. Falcon models are (as of 2023) some of the largest and most powerful open-source language models,\nand consistently rank highly in the [OpenLLM leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open\\_llm\\_leaderboard). ## Converting custom checkpoints\nFalcon models were initially added to the Hugging Face Hub as custom code checkpoints. However, Falcon is now fully\nsupported in the Transformers library. If you fine-tuned a model from a custom code checkpoint, we recommend converting\nyour checkpoint to the new in-library format, as this should give significant improvements to stability and\nperformance, especially for generation, as well as removing the need to use `trust\\_remote\\_code=True`! You can convert custom code checkpoints to full Transformers checkpoints using the `convert\\_custom\\_code\\_checkpoint.py`\nscript located in the\n[Falcon model directory](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/src/transformers/models/falcon)\nof the Transformers library. To use this script, simply call it with\n`python convert\\_custom\\_code\\_checkpoint.py --checkpoint\\_dir my\\_model`. This will convert your checkpoint in-place, and\nyou can immediately load it from the directory afterwards with e.g. `from\\_pretrained()`. If your model hasn't been\nuploaded to the Hub, we recommend making a backup before attempting the conversion, just in case! ## FalconConfig\n[[autodoc]] FalconConfig\n- all\n## FalconModel\n[[autodoc]] FalconModel\n- forward\n## FalconForCausalLM\n[[autodoc]] FalconForCausalLM\n- forward\n## FalconForSequenceClassification\n[[autodoc]] FalconForSequenceClassification\n- forward\n## FalconForTokenClassification\n[[autodoc]] FalconForTokenClassification\n- forward\n## FalconForQuestionAnswering\n[[autodoc]] FalconForQuestionAnswering\n- forward"", ""The Falcon models, data, and training process were detailed in a technical report and a [later research paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2311.16867).
