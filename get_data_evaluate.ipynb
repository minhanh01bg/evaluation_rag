[Sparse Transformers (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10509)) attention and global attention that scales linearly with the sequence length. As opposed to previous long-range transformer models (e.g. [Transformer-XL (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02860), [Reformer (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451), [Adaptive Attention Span (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07799)), Longformer’s self-attention layer is designed as a drop-in replacement for the standard self-attention, thus making it possible to leverage pre-trained checkpoints for further pre-training and/or fine-tuning on long sequence tasks.\\n\\nThe standard self-attention matrix (Figure a) scales quadratically with the input length:\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img src=\"/blog/assets/14_long_range_transformers/Longformer.png\" alt=\"Longformer attention\"/>\\n  <figcaption>Figure taken from Longformer</figcaption>\\n</figure>',\n",

The first key distinction to understand is the difference between **TPU Nodes** and **TPU VMs.**\\n\\nWhen you use a **TPU Node**, you are effectively indirectly accessing a remote TPU. You will need a separate VM, which will initialize your network and data pipeline and then forward them to the remote node. When you use a TPU on Google Colab, you are accessing it in the **TPU Node** style.\\n\\nUsing TPU Nodes can have some quite unexpected behaviour for people who aren’t used to them! In particular, because the TPU is located on a physically different system to the machine you’re running your Python code on, your data cannot be local to your machine - any data pipeline that loads from your machine’s internal storage will totally fail! Instead, data must be stored in Google Cloud Storage where your data pipeline can still access it, even when the pipeline is running on the remote TPU node.\\n\\n<Tip>\\n\\nIf you can fit all your data in memory as `np.ndarray` or `tf.Tensor`, then you can `fit()` on that data even when using Colab or a TPU Node, without needing to upload it to Google Cloud Storage.\\n\\n</Tip>\\n\\n<Tip>\\n\\n**🤗Specific Hugging Face Tip🤗:** The methods `Dataset.to_tf_dataset()` and its higher-level wrapper `model.prepare_tf_dataset()` , which you will see throughout our TF code examples, will both fail on a TPU Node. The reason for this is that even though they create a `tf.data.Dataset` it is not a “pure” `tf.data` pipeline and uses `tf.numpy_function` or `Dataset.from_generator()` to stream data from the underlying HuggingFace `Dataset`. This HuggingFace `Dataset` is backed by data that is on a local disc and which the remote TPU Node will not be able to read.\\n\\n</Tip>',\n",

The first key distinction to understand is the difference between **TPU Nodes** and **TPU VMs.**\\n\\nWhen you use a **TPU Node**, you are effectively indirectly accessing a remote TPU. You will need a separate VM, which will initialize your network and data pipeline and then forward them to the remote node. When you use a TPU on Google Colab, you are accessing it in the **TPU Node** style.\\n\\nUsing TPU Nodes can have some quite unexpected behaviour for people who aren’t used to them! In particular, because the TPU is located on a physically different system to the machine you’re running your Python code on, your data cannot be local to your machine - any data pipeline that loads from your machine’s internal storage will totally fail! Instead, data must be stored in Google Cloud Storage where your data pipeline can still access it, even when the pipeline is running on the remote TPU node.\\n\\n<Tip>\\n\\nIf you can fit all your data in memory as `np.ndarray` or `tf.Tensor`, then you can `fit()` on that data even when using Colab or a TPU Node, without needing to upload it to Google Cloud Storage.\\n\\n</Tip>\\n\\n<Tip>\\n\\n**🤗Specific Hugging Face Tip🤗:** The methods `Dataset.to_tf_dataset()` and its higher-level wrapper `model.prepare_tf_dataset()` , which you will see throughout our TF code examples, will both fail on a TPU Node.
